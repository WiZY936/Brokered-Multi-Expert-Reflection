Relevant Context: Rapid prescreening (RPS) is one of the quality assurance (QA) methods used in gynecologic cytology. The efficacy of RPS has been previously studied but mostly with respect to squamous lesions; in fact, there has been no study so far specifically looking at the sensitivity of RPS for detecting glandular cell abnormalities.
A total of 80,565 Papanicolaou (Pap) smears underwent RPS during a 25-month period. A sample was designated as "review for abnormality" (R) if any abnormal cells (at the threshold of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance/atypical glandular cells [AGC]) were thought to be present or was designated as negative (N) if none were detected. Each sample then underwent full screening (FS) and was designated as either R or N and also given a cytologic interpretation.
The final cytologic interpretation was a glandular cell abnormality (≥AGC) in 107 samples (0.13%); 39 of these (36.4%) were flagged as R on RPS. Twenty-four patients (33.8%) out of 71 who had histologic follow-up were found to harbor a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or carcinoma; 13 of those 24 Pap smears (54.2%) had been flagged as R on RPS. Notably, 11 AGC cases were picked up by RPS only and not by FS and represented false-negative cases; 2 of these showed endometrial adenocarcinoma on histologic follow-up.
Question: Pap smears with glandular cell abnormalities: Are they detected by rapid prescreening?
Thought: The context provided discusses the use of rapid prescreening (RPS) in detecting glandular cell abnormalities in Pap smears. From the information given, it is clear that RPS is effective in detecting glandular cell abnormalities, as it flagged a significant number of samples that were later confirmed to have abnormalities.
Action: Finish[Yes, Pap smears with glandular cell abnormalities are detected by rapid prescreening]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Pap smears with glandular cell abnormalities are often flagged as abnormal by RPS, and this results in a sensitivity of 36.4% (at the AGC threshold). Most importantly, some cases of AGC are detected on Pap smears by RPS only, and this demonstrates that RPS is a valuable QA method.

Relevant Context: It is generally assumed, that patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) are at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. Therefore we performed this case control study to estimate the real risk for bleeding complications of these patients.
Between 05/95 and 07/98, ten patients with WD (eight males, two females) underwent cardiac surgery employing extracorporeal circulation (WD-group). Five of these patients with platelet counts below 80/nl were treated by immunoglobulins preoperatively. Each patient with WD was matched to five patients without WD (no-WD-group) using diagnosis, age, gender, ejection fraction, number of distal anastomosis and body-mass-index as matching criteria.
Mean number of platelet counts were significant lower in the WD-group than in the no-WD-group despite a significant increase of platelet counts after immunoglobulin treatment (54/nl-->112/nl, P=0.018). On the day before, directly after and on the first day after surgery they were 141/nl vs. 215/nl (P=0.012), 75/nl vs. 147/nl (P=0.001) and 93/nl vs. 136/nl (P=0.009). Accordingly, patients of the WD-group received significantly more platelet concentrates than patients of the no-WD-group (mean number of platelet concentrates: 2.3 versus 0.7, P=0.007). Total drainage loss via the mediastinal chest tubes was almost identical (1197 ml in the no-WD-group and 1140 ml in the WD-group). One patient of each group suffered from a bleeding complication requiring reexploration. Three patients of the no-WD-group (6%) and one patient of the WD-group (10%) expired postoperatively unrelated to WD.
Question: Are patients with Werlhof's disease at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery?
Thought: The context provided indicates that patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) are indeed at an increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. This is supported by the lower platelet counts in the WD-group compared to the no-WD-group, as well as the need for more platelet concentrates and the occurrence of bleeding complications in these patients.
Action: Finish[Yes, patients with Werlhof's disease are at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Patients with WD may possibly undergo cardiac surgery without a markedly enhanced risk for bleeding complications despite a more than usual transfusion requirement and significantly lower platelet counts perioperatively.

Relevant Context: Sublingual varices have earlier been related to ageing, smoking and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sublingual varices are related to presence of hypertension.
In an observational clinical study among 431 dental patients tongue status and blood pressure were documented. Digital photographs of the lateral borders of the tongue for grading of sublingual varices were taken, and blood pressure was measured. Those patients without previous diagnosis of hypertension and with a noted blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or ≥ 90 mmHg at the dental clinic performed complementary home blood pressure during one week. Those with an average home blood pressure ≥ 135 mmHg and/or ≥ 85 mmHg were referred to the primary health care centre, where three office blood pressure measurements were taken with one week intervals. Two independent blinded observers studied the photographs of the tongues. Each photograph was graded as none/few (grade 0) or medium/severe (grade 1) presence of sublingual varices. Pearson's Chi-square test, Student's t-test, and multiple regression analysis were applied. Power calculation stipulated a study population of 323 patients.
An association between sublingual varices and hypertension was found (OR = 2.25, p<0.002). Mean systolic blood pressure was 123 and 132 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual varices, respectively (p<0.0001, CI 95 %). Mean diastolic blood pressure was 80 and 83 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual varices, respectively (p<0.005, CI 95 %). Sublingual varices indicate hypertension with a positive predictive value of 0.5 and a negative predictive value of 0.80.
Question: Is there a connection between sublingual varices and hypertension?
Thought: The context provided indicates that there is indeed a connection between sublingual varices and hypertension, as shown by the results of the study conducted on dental patients.
Action: Finish[Yes, there is a connection between sublingual varices and hypertension, as indicated by the study results showing an odds ratio of 2.25 and significant differences in blood pressure measurements between patients with and without sublingual varices.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: An association was found between sublingual varices and hypertension. Examining the lateral borders of the tongue is easily done, causes no harm and could be a valuable method for the dental profession to take active part in preventive healthcare.

Relevant Context: Broad-based electronic health information exchange (HIE), in which patients' clinical data follow them between care delivery settings, is expected to produce large quality gains and cost savings. Although these benefits are assumed to result from reducing redundant care, there is limited supporting empirical evidence.
To evaluate whether HIE adoption is associated with decreases in repeat imaging in emergency departments (EDs).DATA SOURCE/
ED discharge data from the State Emergency Department Databases for California and Florida for 2007-2010 were merged with Health Information Management Systems Society data that report hospital HIE participation.
Using regression with ED fixed effects and trends, we performed a retrospective analysis of the impact of HIE participation on repeat imaging, comparing 37 EDs that initiated HIE participation during the study period to 410 EDs that did not participate in HIE during the same period. Within 3 common types of imaging tests [computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and chest x-ray), we defined a repeat image for a given patient as the same study in the same body region performed within 30 days at unaffiliated EDs.
In our sample there were 20,139 repeat CTs (representing 14.7% of those cases with CT in the index visit), 13,060 repeat ultrasounds (20.7% of ultrasound cases), and 29,703 repeat chest x-rays (19.5% of x-ray cases). HIE was associated with reduced probability of repeat ED imaging in all 3 modalities: -8.7 percentage points for CT [95% confidence interval (CI): -14.7, -2.7], -9.1 percentage points for ultrasound (95% CI: -17.2, -1.1), and -13.0 percentage points for chest x-ray (95% CI: -18.3, -7.7), reflecting reductions of 44%-67% relative to sample means.
Question: Does health information exchange reduce redundant imaging?
Thought: The question is asking whether health information exchange reduces redundant imaging based on the context provided. The study mentioned in the context shows that HIE participation was associated with reduced probability of repeat ED imaging in all three modalities (CT, ultrasound, and chest x-ray), with significant percentage point reductions.
Action: Finish[Yes, health information exchange reduces redundant imaging]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: HIE was associated with reduced repeat imaging in EDs. This study is among the first to find empirical support for this anticipated benefit of HIE.

Relevant Context: Specialty pharmaceuticals have evolved beyond their status as niche drugs designed to treat rare conditions and are now poised to become the standard of care in a wide variety of common chronic illnesses. Due in part to the cost of these therapies, payers are increasingly demanding evidence of their value. Determining the value of these medications is hampered by a lack of robust pharmacoeconomic data.
To outline emerging strategies and case study examples for the medical and pharmacy benefits management of specialty pharmaceuticals.
The promise of specialty pharmaceuticals: increased life expectancy, improved quality of life, enhanced workplace productivity, decreased burden of disease, and reduced health care spending comes at a significant cost. These agents require special handling, administration, patient education, clinical support, and risk mitigation. Additionally, specialty drugs require distribution systems that ensure appropriate patient selection and data collection. With the specialty pharmaceutical pipeline overflowing with new medicines and an aging population increasingly relying on these novel treatments to treat common diseases, the challenge of managing the costs associated with these agents can be daunting. Aided by sophisticated pharmacoeconomic models to assess value, the cost impacts of these specialty drugs can be appropriately controlled.
Question: The promise of specialty pharmaceuticals: are they worth the price?
Thought: The question is asking about the value of specialty pharmaceuticals in relation to their cost. Based on the context provided, specialty pharmaceuticals offer increased life expectancy, improved quality of life, enhanced workplace productivity, decreased burden of disease, and reduced health care spending. However, they come at a significant cost and require special handling, administration, and support. The value of these medications can be determined through pharmacoeconomic data analysis.
Action: Finish[Specialty pharmaceuticals offer increased life expectancy, improved quality of life, enhanced workplace productivity, decreased burden of disease, and reduced health care spending, but come at a significant cost. The value of these medications can be determined through pharmacoeconomic data analysis.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Current evidence suggests that when used in targeted patient populations, specialty pharmaceuticals may represent a good health care value.

Relevant Context: The aim of the present study was to explore patients' views on the acceptability and feasibility of using colour to describe osteoarthritis (OA) pain, and whether colour could be used to communicate pain to healthcare professionals.
Six group interviews were conducted with 17 patients with knee OA. Discussion topics included first impressions about using colour to describe pain, whether participants could associate their pain with colour, how colours related to changes to intensity and different pain qualities, and whether they could envisage using colour to describe pain to healthcare professionals.
The group interviews indicated that, although the idea of using colour was generally acceptable, it did not suit all participants as a way of describing their pain. The majority of participants chose red to describe high-intensity pain; the reasons given were because red symbolized inflammation, fire, anger and the stop signal in a traffic light system. Colours used to describe the absence of pain were chosen because of their association with positive emotional feelings, such as purity, calmness and happiness. A range of colours was chosen to represent changes in pain intensity. Aching pain was consistently identified as being associated with colours such as grey or black, whereas sharp pain was described using a wider selection of colours. The majority of participants thought that they would be able to use colour to describe their pain to healthcare professionals, although issues around the interpretability and standardization of colour were raised.
Question: The colour of pain: can patients use colour to describe osteoarthritis pain?
Thought: The question is asking if patients can use color to describe osteoarthritis pain based on the context provided. The study conducted group interviews with patients with knee OA to explore this topic.
Action: Finish[Yes, patients can use color to describe osteoarthritis pain based on the group interviews conducted in the study.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.

Relevant Context: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of ureteroscopy for lower ureteric stones without the use of fluoroscopy.
Between June 2001 and January 2005, a total of 110 patients with a mean age of 33.5 years (range 12-65) suffering from of lower ureteral calculi (below the upper margin of the sacroiliac joint) prospectively underwent ureteroscopic removal. Retrograde pyelography was avoided, and no safety guidewire was placed. Whenever required, the ureteric meatus was dilated with a ureteric balloon under direct vision. Double-J stent placement was done with the aid of ureteroscopy. A fluoroscope was kept standby. The patients had a postoperative X-ray of the kidney-ureter-bladder region to document the stone clearance.
The mean stone size was 8.7 mm (range 6-15). Complete clearance without the use of fluoroscopy was achieved in 99 patients (94.2%). Fluoroscopy was required in 6 patients (4%) for calcified stricture (n = 1), duplex system (n = 1), narrow and tortuous meatus causing difficulty in passing the 5-Fr balloon dilator (n = 3), and confirmation of spontaneous passage of the stone (n = 1). Of the 13 patients who required balloon dilatation it was successfully achieved without fluoroscopy. Double-J stenting was done due to mucosal ulceration (n = 3), polypoid reaction (n = 2), and perforation (n = 1). All these patients had correct placement of the stent, as confirmed by X-ray of the kidney-ureter-bladder region postoperatively.
Question: Is fluoroscopy essential for retrieval of lower ureteric stones?
Thought: The context provided indicates that in this study, ureteroscopy for lower ureteric stones was successfully performed without the use of fluoroscopy in the majority of cases. Only a small percentage of patients required fluoroscopy for specific reasons. Therefore, based on this information, fluoroscopy does not seem to be essential for the retrieval of lower ureteric stones.
Action: Finish[Fluoroscopy is not essential for retrieval of lower ureteric stones]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.

Relevant Context: Neutrophil infiltration of the lung is characteristic of early posttraumatic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study examines the ability of neutrophils isolated (over the first 24 hrs) from the peripheral blood of patients admitted after major trauma to migrate in response to interleukin-8. Interleukin-8 is elevated in the lung within 2 hrs of major trauma in patients who later develop ARDS, and thus it plays a central role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and their subsequent activation. We hypothesized that enhanced interleukin-8-mediated neutrophil migratory activity in the early postinjury phase, before the development of ARDS, may be a crucial factor in the etiology of ARDS.
Prospective observational study.
University Hospital Wales, the Royal Gwent Hospital, and East Glamorgan General Hospital. Laboratory work was conducted at the Institute of Nephrology.
Adult blunt trauma victims with Injury Severity Score>or = 18.
Neutrophils were isolated from citrated blood from 17 adult blunt major trauma patients at admission (0 hrs) and 8 and 24 hrs later. Identical samples were obtained from normal laboratory volunteers (n = 9). The neutrophil count in each specimen was measured, and the number of neutrophils migrating across porous tissue culture inserts in response to defined concentrations of interleukin-8 (0, 10, 30, and 100 ng/mL) was quantitated by peroxidase assay. Neutrophil counts in the whole blood specimens obtained from those later developing ARDS were elevated significantly at admission and declined rapidly throughout the next 24 hrs. Significantly greater numbers of trauma patients' neutrophils migrated to concentrations of interleukin-8 (30 and 100 ng/mL) at each time point when compared with normal volunteers (Mann-Whitney U test, p<.05). Neutrophils isolated from major trauma patients exhibited an enhanced migratory response to high concentrations of interleukin-8 throughout the first 24 hrs of admission, in contrast to the normal physiologic attenuation of migration seen in neutrophils isolated from normal laboratory volunteers.
Question: Increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma: a factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome?
Thought: The context provided discusses the relationship between neutrophil migratory activity and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after major trauma. The study hypothesizes that enhanced interleukin-8-mediated neutrophil migratory activity in the early postinjury phase may be a crucial factor in the etiology of ARDS.
Action: Finish[Yes, increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma, particularly in response to interleukin-8, is suggested to be a factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.

Relevant Context: To investigate the relevance of the Symptom Checklist 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale to cognition in individuals with brain tumor.
A prospective study of patients assessed with a neuropsychological test battery.
A university medical center.
Nineteen adults with biopsy-confirmed diagnoses of malignant brain tumors were assessed prior to aggressive chemotherapy.
Included in the assessment were the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, California Verbal Learning Test, Trail Making Test B, Symptom Checklist 90-R, Mood Assessment Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Chronic Illness Problem Inventory.
The SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale was not related to objective measures of attention, verbal memory, or age. It was related significantly to symptoms of depression (r = .81, P<.005), anxiety (r = .66, P<.005), and subjective complaints of memory problems (r = .75, P<.005). Multivariate analyses indicated that reported symptoms of depression contributed 66% of the variance in predicting SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive Scores, whereas symptoms of anxiety contributed an additional 6% (P<.0001).
Question: Does the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension identify cognitive impairments?
Thought: The context provided indicates that the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension is not related to objective measures of attention or verbal memory but is significantly related to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and subjective complaints of memory problems. Therefore, based on this information, it does not seem to identify cognitive impairments directly.
Action: Finish[No, the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension does not directly identify cognitive impairments.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic effects of structural brain injury.

Relevant Context: Disorders of consciousness (DOC) diagnosis relies on the presence or absence of purposeful motor responsiveness, which characterizes the minimally conscious state (MCS) and the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), respectively. Functional neuroimaging studies have raised the question of possible residual conscious awareness also in clinically-defined UWS patients. The aim of our study was to identify electrophysiological parameters, by means of a transcranial magnetic stimulation approach, which might potentially express the presence of residual networks sustaining fragmentary behavioral patterns, even when no conscious behavior can be observed.
We enrolled 25 severe DOC patients, following post-anoxic or traumatic brain injury and 20 healthy individuals (HC) as control group. Baseline electrophysiological evaluation evidenced, in comparison to HC, a partial preservation of cortical effective connectivity and excitability in clinically defined MCS, whereas these components were absent in clinically defined UWS. Then, we applied an anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) protocol over the orbitofrontal cortex.
a-tDCS was able to boost cortical connectivity and excitability in all HC, MCS, and to unmask such excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients.
Question: Can transcranial direct current stimulation be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome from minimally conscious state patients?
Thought: The context provided indicates that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was able to boost cortical connectivity and excitability in minimally conscious state (MCS) patients and unmask such excitability/connectivity in some unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients. Therefore, tDCS can be useful in differentiating between these two states.
Action: Finish[Yes, transcranial direct current stimulation can be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome from minimally conscious state patients.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.

Relevant Context: To determine whether prostate morphology or technique used has any effect on postoperative outcomes after holmium laser enucleation of the prostate.
A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was completed for all patients undergoing a holmium laser enucleation of the prostate at our institution. Prostate morphology was classified as either "bilobar" or "trilobar" according to the cystoscopic appearance. The baseline characteristics, complications, and postoperative outcomes were collected.
A total of 304 patients with either "bilobar" (n = 142) or "trilobar" (n = 162) prostate morphology were included. The trilobar group was more likely to have longer operative times (112 vs 100 minutes, P = .04), although this difference was not significant on multivariate analysis. The postoperative outcomes were similar between the 2 groups for American Urological Association symptom score, change in American Urological Association symptom score, bother score, maximal flow rate, change in maximal flow rate, postvoid residual urine volume, and complication rate. However, the trilobar group had a significantly greater decrease in their PVR urine volume (296 vs 176 mL, P = .01), a difference that persisted on multivariate analysis. A subset analysis of the trilobar prostates revealed that performing a 2-lobe technique achieved shorter operative and enucleation times, although the difference was not significant.
Question: Does prostate morphology affect outcomes after holmium laser enucleation?
Thought: The context provided indicates that a study was conducted to determine if prostate morphology has any effect on postoperative outcomes after holmium laser enucleation. The study found that while there were some differences in operative times and postoperative outcomes between "bilobar" and "trilobar" prostate morphologies, the overall impact was not significant for most outcomes. However, the trilobar group did show a significantly greater decrease in postvoid residual urine volume compared to the bilobar group.
Action: Finish[Prostate morphology does not significantly affect outcomes after holmium laser enucleation, except for a greater decrease in postvoid residual urine volume in the trilobar group.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Those patients with trilobar prostate morphology are more likely to achieve a greater decrease in the PVR urine volume after holmium laser enucleation of the prostate. All other outcomes appeared to be similar between the 2 groups. In addition, a 2-lobe technique can be safely used for trilobar prostates when deemed feasible by the surgeon.

Relevant Context: Deaths from injury and poisoning (suicide, accidents, undetermined deaths, and homicide) are the major cause of death among young men aged 15-39 years in England and Wales and have been increasing in recent years.AIM: To describe common characteristics among young men who die from injury and poisoning.
We employed a retrospective survey methodology to investigate factors associated with deaths by injury and poisoning among young men aged 15-39 years (n = 268) in Merseyside and Cheshire during 1995. Data were collected from Coroner's inquest notes and General Practitioner records.
The most common cause of death was poisoning by alcohol and drugs (29.1%, n = 78). A high proportion of cases were unemployed (39.4%, n = 106). Cases were also more likely to be single compared to the general population (74.2% vs 55.5%). Self-destructive behaviour was evident in 77% of deaths (n = 206).
Question: Injury and poisoning mortality among young men--are there any common factors amenable to prevention?
Thought: The context provided highlights that the most common cause of death among young men aged 15-39 years is poisoning by alcohol and drugs, with a high proportion of cases being unemployed and single. Self-destructive behavior was also evident in a significant number of deaths. These factors suggest that mental health support, substance abuse prevention programs, and employment opportunities could be key factors amenable to prevention.
Action: Finish[Mental health support, substance abuse prevention programs, and employment opportunities]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Alcohol and drug use are important contributory factors to injury and poisoning deaths. More research is needed into the effects of unemployment and being single on the health of young men, and to investigate the motivations behind risk taking and self-destructive behaviour.

Relevant Context: Home blood pressure (BP) monitoring is gaining increasing popularity among patients and may be useful in hypertension management. Little is known about the reliability of stroke patients' records of home BP monitoring.
To assess the reliability of home BP recording in hypertensive patients who had suffered a recent stroke or transient ischaemic attack.
Thirty-nine stroke patients (mean age 73 years) randomized to the intervention arm of a trial of home BP monitoring were included. Following instruction by a research nurse, patients recorded their BPs at home and documented them in a booklet over the next year. The booklet readings over a month were compared with the actual readings downloaded from the BP monitor and were checked for errors or selective bias in recording.
A total of 1027 monitor and 716 booklet readings were recorded. Ninety per cent of booklet recordings were exactly the same as the BP monitor readings. Average booklet readings were 0.6 mmHg systolic [95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.6 to 1.8] and 0.3 mmHg diastolic (95% CI -0.3 to 0.8) lower than those on the monitor.
Question: Are stroke patients' reports of home blood pressure readings reliable?
Thought: The context provided indicates that 90% of the booklet recordings were exactly the same as the BP monitor readings, with only a small difference in average readings. This suggests that stroke patients' reports of home blood pressure readings are reliable.
Action: Finish[Yes, stroke patients' reports of home blood pressure readings are reliable]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: This group of elderly stroke patients were able to record their BPs reliably at home. Any bias was small and would be unlikely to affect management. Since BP readings in a GP surgery are often a poor indication of true BP, GPs might consider using hypertensive patients' records of home BP monitoring to help guide treatment decisions.

Relevant Context: We have reported previously that cerulein-induced edematous pancreatitis would transform into hemorrhagic pancreatitis by administration of endothelin-1 in rats. In the present study, we tried to protect rat model from developing into hemorrhagic pancreatitis with BQ123 (an ETA receptor antagonist).
The rat model was made by 5-hour restraint water-immersion stress and two intraperitoneal injections of cerulein (40 micrograms/kg) at hourly interval. BQ123 (3 or 6 mg/kg) was administered intravenously 30 minutes before and 2 hours after the first cerulein injection.
Acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis was induced in all rats treated with cerulin + stress. The score for pancreatic hemorrhage was 2.4 +/- 0.2 in this group. In the rats pretreated with BQ123, the score was reduced to 1.0 +/- 0.0, pancreas wet weight and serum amylase activity were significantly reduced, and histologic alterations in the pancreas lightened, also the local pancreatic blood flow improved without affecting the systemic blood pressure.
Question: Is endothelin-1 an aggravating factor in the development of acute pancreatitis?
Thought: The context provided indicates that administration of endothelin-1 in rats transformed edematous pancreatitis into hemorrhagic pancreatitis. However, when an ETA receptor antagonist (BQ123) was administered, the development of hemorrhagic pancreatitis was prevented. Therefore, endothelin-1 can be considered an aggravating factor in the development of acute pancreatitis.
Action: Finish[Yes, endothelin-1 is an aggravating factor in the development of acute pancreatitis.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: These results suggest that endothelin-1 should play a role in aggravating the development of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis, through its action on the pancreatic microcirculation.

Relevant Context: Hyperleptinemia and oxidative stress play a major role in the development of cardiovascular diseases in obesity. This study aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between plasma levels of leptin and phagocytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity, and its potential relevance in the vascular remodeling in obese patients.
The study was performed in 164 obese and 94 normal-weight individuals (controls). NADPH oxidase activity was evaluated by luminescence in phagocytic cells. Levels of leptin were quantified by ELISA in plasma samples. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) was measured by ultrasonography. In addition, we performed in-vitro experiments in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine macrophages.
Phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity and leptin levels were enhanced (P<0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. NADPH oxidase activity positively correlated with leptin in obese patients. This association remained significant in a multivariate analysis. cIMT was higher (P<0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. In addition, cIMT also correlated positively with leptin and NADPH oxidase activity in obese patients. In-vitro studies showed that leptin induced NADPH oxidase activation. Inhibition of the leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activity by wortmannin and bisindolyl maleimide suggested a direct involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C pathways, respectively. Finally, leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activation promoted macrophage proliferation.
Question: Is leptin involved in phagocytic NADPH oxidase overactivity in obesity?
Thought: The context provided indicates that there is a relationship between plasma levels of leptin and phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity in obese patients. The study found that NADPH oxidase activity positively correlated with leptin in obese patients, and in-vitro experiments showed that leptin induced NADPH oxidase activation. Therefore, leptin is indeed involved in phagocytic NADPH oxidase overactivity in obesity.
Action: Finish[Yes, leptin is involved in phagocytic NADPH oxidase overactivity in obesity.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: These findings show that phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity is increased in obesity and is related to preclinical atherosclerosis in this condition. We also suggest that hyperleptinemia may contribute to phagocytic NADPH oxidase overactivity in obesity.

Relevant Context: The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcomes that are associated with pregnancy and treated hypothyroidism.
This was a retrospective cohort study of all women who received prenatal care and were delivered at the University of California, San Francisco, between 1989 and 2001. All patients with hypothyroidism diagnosed before pregnancy or early in pregnancy were identified. Maternal, fetal, and obstetric outcomes were then collected and analyzed for women with hypothyroidism and compared with women without hypothyroidism.
Among 20,499 deliveries, there were 419 women (2.1%) who were treated for hypothyroidism during the study period. Hypothyroidism was more common among women>or =35 years old, white women, and women without Medicaid insurance. Treated hypothyroidism was not associated with any increase in maternal, fetal, or neonatal complications. In addition, hypothyroidism did not affect mode of delivery.
Question: Are women who are treated for hypothyroidism at risk for pregnancy complications?
Thought: The question is asking about the risk of pregnancy complications for women treated for hypothyroidism. Based on the context provided, it is clear that treated hypothyroidism was not associated with any increase in maternal, fetal, or neonatal complications, nor did it affect the mode of delivery.
Action: Finish[Women who are treated for hypothyroidism are not at risk for pregnancy complications.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Compared with patients without hypothyroidism, patients with treated hypothyroidism are not at any increased risk for perinatal morbidity.

Relevant Context: Epidemiological studies have suggested inverse relationships between blood pressure and prevalence of conditions such as migraine and headache. It is not yet clear whether similar relationships can be established for back pain in particular in prospective studies.
Associations between blood pressure and chronic low back pain were explored in the cross-sectional HUNT 2 survey of a Norwegian county in 1995-1997, including 39,872 individuals who never used antihypertensive medication. A prospective study, comprising 17,209 initially back pain-free individuals and 5740 individuals reporting low back pain, was established by re-examinations in the HUNT 3 survey in 2006-2008. Associations were assessed by logistic regression with respect to systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure, with adjustment for education, work status, physical activity, smoking, body mass and lipid levels.
In the cross-sectional study, all three blood pressure measures showed inverse relationships with prevalence of low back pain in both sexes. In the prospective study of disease-free women, baseline pulse pressure and systolic pressure were inversely associated with risk of low back pain [odds ratio (OR) 0.93 per 10 mm Hg increase in pulse pressure, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89-0.98, p = 0.007; OR 0.95 per 10 mm Hg increase in systolic pressure, 95% CI 0.92-0.99, p = 0.005]. Results among men were equivocal. No associations were indicated with the occurrence of pain in individuals with low back pain at baseline.
Question: Does high blood pressure reduce the risk of chronic low back pain?
Thought: The context provided discusses the relationship between blood pressure and chronic low back pain. Based on the information given, it seems that high blood pressure, specifically pulse pressure and systolic pressure, may actually reduce the risk of chronic low back pain in women, but the results are unclear for men.
Action: Finish[High blood pressure may reduce the risk of chronic low back pain in women, but results are equivocal for men.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Results for low back pain are consistent with the theory of hypertension-associated hypalgesia, predicting diminished pain sensitivity with increasing blood pressure, possibly with modified reactions in people suffering from long-lasting pain.

Relevant Context: Acute pancreatitis is the major complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure and there are some reports showing cytokine changes in ERCP-induced pancreatits.GOALS: To investigate the association between early changes (within 24 hours) in the serum interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, and IL-6 levels and the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis.STUDY: Forty five consecutive patients who underwent therapeutic ERCP and 10 patients with acute pancreatitis without ERCP were enrolled to the study. Serum concentrations of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 were determined immediately before, 12 hours and 24 hours after ERCP.
Seven of the 45 patients (15.5%) developed post-ERCP pancreatitis. The levels of IL-4 at 24 hours after ERCP were significantly lower in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis than in those without pancreatitis, while TNFalpha levels at 12 hours after ERCP were higher in the complicated group than those of the uncomplicated group. The ratios of TNFalpha/IL-4 at 12 and 24 hours after ERCP were found significantly higher in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis than in those without pancreatitis. IL-6 in the complicated patients was found significantly increased at 24 hours after ERCP.
Question: Do the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 reflect the inflammatory activity in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis?
Thought: The question is asking if the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 reflect the inflammatory activity in patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis. Based on the context provided, it is clear that the levels of these cytokines are associated with the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis, with specific changes in IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 levels being linked to the condition.
Action: Finish[Yes, the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 do reflect the inflammatory activity in patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.

Relevant Context: Most pediatric surgeons perform oophorectomy in girls presenting with ovarian torsion in which the ovary appears necrotic. However, the adult gynecology literature suggests that many ovaries can be treated by detorsion alone.
All children with ovarian torsion on the gynecology and general surgery services between 1988 and 2002 were reviewed.
There were 36 torsions in 34 children. Seventeen underwent detorsion with or without ovarian cystectomy, and 19 had oophorectomy (mean age 10 years in both groups). Torsion was suspected preoperatively in 94% of the detorsion cases and in 47% of the oophorectomy patients. Median time from presentation to surgery was significantly lower in the detorsion than the oophorectomy group (median 14 v 27 hours; P =.04). Postoperative complications and length of stay were similar between the 2 groups. Despite the ovary being judged intraoperatively as moderately to severely ischemic in 53% of the detorsion cases, follow-up sonogram or ovarian biopsy available in 14 of the 17 cases showed normal ovary with follicular development in each case.
Question: Ovarian torsion in children: is oophorectomy necessary?
Thought: The context provided discusses a study on ovarian torsion in children and the outcomes of detorsion versus oophorectomy. Based on the findings that detorsion alone was successful in many cases, it suggests that oophorectomy may not be necessary in all cases of ovarian torsion in children.
Action: Finish[Oophorectomy may not be necessary in all cases of ovarian torsion in children, as detorsion alone was successful in many cases according to the study findings.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.

Relevant Context: To assess the results of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in patients with Cushing's disease over a period of 18 years, and to determine if there are factors which will predict the outcome.
Sixty-nine sequential patients treated surgically by a single surgeon in Newcastle upon Tyne between 1980 and 1997 were identified and data from 61 of these have been analysed.
Retrospective analysis of outcome measures.
Patients were divided into three groups (remission, failure and relapse) depending on the late outcome of their treatment as determined at the time of analysis, i.e. 88 months (median) years after surgery. Remission is defined as biochemical reversal of hypercortisolism with re-emergence of diurnal circadian rhythm, resolution of clinical features and adequate suppression on low-dose dexamethasone testing. Failure is defined as the absence of any of these features. Relapse is defined as the re-emergence of Cushing's disease more than one year after operation. Clinical features such as weight, sex, hypertension, associated endocrine disorders and smoking, biochemical studies including preoperative and postoperative serum cortisol, urine free cortisol, serum ACTH, radiological, histological and surgical findings were assessed in relation to these three groups to determine whether any factors could reliably predict failure or relapse after treatment.
Of the 61 patients included in this study, 48 (78.7%) achieved initial remission and 13 (21.3%) failed treatment. Seven patients suffered subsequent relapse (range 22-158 months) in their condition after apparent remission, leaving a final group of 41 patients (67.2%) in the remission group. Tumour was identified at surgery in 52 patients, of whom 38 achieved remission. In comparison, only 3 of 9 patients in whom no tumour was identified achieved remission. This difference was significant (P = 0.048). When both radiological and histological findings were positive, the likelihood of achieving remission was significantly higher than if both modalities were negative (P = 0.038). There were significant differences between remission and failure groups when 2- and 6-week postoperative serum cortisol levels (P = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively) and 6-week postoperative urine free cortisol levels (P = 0.026) were compared. This allowed identification of patients who failed surgical treatment in the early postoperative period. Complications of surgery included transitory DI in 13, transitory CSF leak in 8 and transitory nasal discharge and cacosmia in 3. Twelve of 41 patients required some form of hormonal replacement therapy despite achieving long-term remission. Thirteen patients underwent a second operation, of whom 5 achieved remission.
Question: Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in Cushing's disease: can we predict outcome?
Thought: The question is asking if the outcome of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in Cushing's disease can be predicted based on certain factors. The context provided details the factors assessed in relation to the outcome groups of remission, failure, and relapse.
Action: Finish[Tumour identification at surgery, radiological and histological findings, postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol levels, complications of surgery, need for hormonal replacement therapy, and second operation]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.

Relevant Context: The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcomes and patterns of failure in patients with metastatic carcinoma to cervical lymph nodes from an unknown head and neck primary origin, who were treated curatively with radiotherapy, with or without neck dissection.
The study included 61 patients referred to the McGill University Hospital Centers from 1987 to 2002. The median age was 57 years, with male to female ratio of 4:1. Distribution of patients by N status was as follows: N1, 16 patients (26%); N2a, 18 (30%); N2b, 13 (22%); N2c, 7 (11%); and N3, 7 (11%). Twenty patients underwent neck dissection (11 radical, 9 functional) and 41 patients had biopsy (9 fine-needle aspiration and 32 excisional biopsy). All patients received radiotherapy. The median dose to the involved node(s) was 64 Gy, and 60 Gy to the rest of the neck. Treatment of the neck was bilateral in 50 patients (82%) and ipsilateral in 11 (18%). The minimum duration of the follow-up was 12 months, with the median of 32 months.
The 5- and 8-year overall survival for the whole population was 79% and 67%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the 8-year actuarial overall survival (64.8% and 67.6%, respectively, p = .64) and local relapse-free survival (75% vs 74.5%, respectively, p = .57), among patients who had biopsy versus those who had neck dissection.
Question: Metastatic carcinoma to the cervical nodes from an unknown head and neck primary site: Is there a need for neck dissection?
Thought: The question is asking whether there is a need for neck dissection in patients with metastatic carcinoma to cervical nodes from an unknown head and neck primary site. Based on the study provided, it shows that there was no statistically significant difference in overall survival and local relapse-free survival between patients who had biopsy versus those who had neck dissection. Therefore, there may not be a clear need for neck dissection in these cases.
Action: Finish[No clear need for neck dissection in patients with metastatic carcinoma to cervical nodes from an unknown head and neck primary site]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: In our experience, definitive radiotherapy to the neck and the potential mucosal sites, whether preceded by neck dissection or not, is effective to achieve a good local control rate in the unknown primary cancer of the head and neck. The indication for neck dissection, in particular for early nodal stage, is controversial.

Relevant Context: As part of a prospective study on quality of life in newly diagnosed lung cancer patients an investigation was carried out to examine whether there were differences among patients' quality of life scores and their socioeconomic status.
Quality of life was measured at two points in time (baseline and three months after initial treatment) using three standard instruments; the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), the European Organization for Research and Cancer Treatment Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its lung cancer supplement (QLQ-LC13). Socioeconomic status for each individual patient was derived using Carstairs and Morris Deprivation Category ranging from 1 (least deprived) to 7 (most deprived) on the basis of the postcode sector of their address.
In all, 129 lung cancer patients entered into the study. Of these data for 82 patients were complete (at baseline and follow-up). 57% of patients were of lower socioeconomic status and they had more health problems, less functioning, and more symptoms as compared to affluent patients. Of these, physical mobility (P = 0.05), energy (P = 0.01), role functioning (P = 0.04), physical functioning (P = 0.03), and breathlessness (P = 0.02) were significant at baseline. However, at follow-up assessment there was no significant difference between patient groups nor did any consistent pattern emerge.
Question: Quality of life in lung cancer patients: does socioeconomic status matter?
Thought: The question is asking whether socioeconomic status affects the quality of life in lung cancer patients. Based on the context provided, it is evident that lower socioeconomic status is associated with more health problems, less functioning, and more symptoms in these patients. However, these differences were not significant at the follow-up assessment.
Action: Finish[Lower socioeconomic status is associated with more health problems, less functioning, and more symptoms in lung cancer patients, but these differences were not significant at the follow-up assessment.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.

Relevant Context: Neuromedin U (NmU) is a neuropeptide with anorexigenic activity. Two receptor subtypes (NmUR1 and NmUR2) confer the effects of NmU on target cells. We have recently demonstrated that NmU reduces insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets. Aim of our current study is to investigate the role of somatostatin at mediating the effects of NmU on insulin secretion.
Expression of NmU in the pancreas was detected by immunohistochemistry. Insulin and somatostatin secretion from in situ perfused rat pancreas and isolated pancreatic islets was measured by radioimmunoassay. The paracrine effects of somatostatin within pancreatic islets were blocked by cyclosomatostatin, a somatostatin receptor antagonist.
Receptor subtype NmUR1, but not NmUR2, was expressed in the endocrine pancreas, predominantly in the periphery. Neuromedin U reduced insulin secretion from in situ perfused rat pancreas and stimulated somatostatin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets. Neuromedin U stimulated somatostatin secretion at both physiological and supraphysiological glucose concentrations. Cyclosomatostatin increased insulin secretion and reduced NmU-induced inhibition of insulin secretion.
Question: Does somatostatin confer insulinostatic effects of neuromedin u in the rat pancreas?
Thought: The context provided indicates that somatostatin plays a role in mediating the effects of neuromedin U on insulin secretion in the rat pancreas. It is mentioned that somatostatin secretion is stimulated by neuromedin U and that blocking the paracrine effects of somatostatin increases insulin secretion. Therefore, somatostatin does confer insulinostatic effects of neuromedin U in the rat pancreas.
Action: Finish[Yes, somatostatin confers insulinostatic effects of neuromedin U in the rat pancreas.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Neuromedin U reduces insulin and increases somatostatin secretion. Blockade of somatostatin action abolishes the inhibition of insulin secretion by NmU. The results of the study suggest that somatostatin mediates the inhibitory action of NmU on insulin secretion.

Relevant Context: Staging laparoscopy (SL) is not regularly performed for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It may change treatment strategy, preventing unnecessary open exploration. An additional advantage of SL is possible biopsy of the nontumorous liver to assess fibrosis/cirrhosis. This study aimed to determine whether SL for patients with HCC still is useful.
Patients with HCC who underwent SL between January 1999 and December 2011 were analyzed. Their demographics, preoperative imaging studies, surgical findings, and histology were assessed.
The 56 patients (34 men and 22 women; mean age, 60 ± 14 years) in this study underwent SL for assessment of extensive disease or metastases. For two patients, SL was unsuccessful because of intraabdominal adhesions. For four patients (7.1 %), SL showed unresectability because of metastases (n = 1), tumor progression (n = 1), or severe cirrhosis in the contralateral lobe (n = 2). An additional five patients did not undergo laparotomy due to disease progression detected on imaging after SL. Exploratory laparotomy for the remaining 47 patients showed 6 (13 %) additional unresectable tumors due to advanced tumor (n = 5) or nodal metastases (n = 1). Consequently, the yield of SL was 7 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 3-17 %), and the accuracy was 27 % (95 % CI, 11-52 %). A biopsy of the contralateral liver was performed for 45 patients who underwent SL, leading to changes in management for 4 patients (17 %) with cirrhosis.
Question: Staging laparoscopy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: is it useful?
Thought: The question is asking whether staging laparoscopy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma is useful. Based on the context provided, the study found that staging laparoscopy was useful in determining unresectability due to metastases, tumor progression, or severe cirrhosis in some patients. It also allowed for biopsy of the contralateral liver, leading to changes in management for some patients with cirrhosis.
Action: Finish[Yes, staging laparoscopy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was found to be useful in determining unresectability and assessing cirrhosis, leading to changes in management for some patients.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.

Relevant Context: The proper angle of miniscrew insertion is important for cortical anchorage, patient safety, and biomechanical control. The purposes of this study are to report the alveolar process thickness and inter-radicular space in the posterior region of the mandible, to assess the impact of different miniscrew insertion angle protocols, and to identify differences between the genders or types of malocclusion.
In this retrospective study, 100 individuals were selected for orthodontic treatment at a radiology clinic. Cone-beam computed tomography data were imported into 3-dimensional software. The predictor variable was the location in the mandible and insertion angle. The demographic variables collected included age, gender, and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). The primary outcome variables were bone thickness and inter-radicular space. The inter-radicular spaces were evaluated 5 mm from the cement-enamel junction. The bone thicknesses were taken at 45°, 60°, and 90° in relation to the alveolar ridge, simulating a miniscrew insertion. These factors were evaluated for sexual dimorphism and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). Sexual dimorphism and malocclusion were evaluated with t tests. To compare the inter-radicular space and the thickness of bone between areas, an analysis of variance for repeated measures was used.
The sample was composed of 100 patients with a mean age of 17.4 ± 6.74 years. There were 61 female and 39 male patients and 60 Class I and 40 Class II molar relationships. The inter-radicular space ranged from 2.46 to 3.31 mm, and alveolar bone thickness ranged from 8.01 to 13.77 mm. The thickness tended to decrease with the increase in insertion angle from 45° to 90°. No significant differences between the genders or types of malocclusion were found.
Question: Can bone thickness and inter-radicular space affect miniscrew placement in posterior mandibular sites?
Thought: The context provided discusses the importance of bone thickness and inter-radicular space in relation to miniscrew insertion in the posterior mandibular region. Based on the information given, it is clear that bone thickness and inter-radicular space can indeed affect miniscrew placement in these sites.
Action: Finish[Yes, bone thickness and inter-radicular space can affect miniscrew placement in posterior mandibular sites.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The results of this study suggest that the safest areas for the placement of miniscrews are between the first and second premolars and between the first and second molars, regardless of the angle of insertion.

Relevant Context: To evaluate accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) in patients after oncoplastic surgery for early breast cancer.
A retrospective analysis of 136 breasts of 134 patients, who received breast-conserving oncoplastic surgery for low-risk breast cancer between 2002 and 2010 in the Universities of Vienna and Luebeck followed by adjuvant APBI applying total doses of pulse dose rate of 50.4 Gy or high-dose rate (HDR) of 32 Gy over 4 days. Target volume definition was performed by the use of surgical-free margin data, related to intraoperatively fixed clip positions, pre- and postoperative imaging, and palpation.
At the time of data acquisition, 131 of 134 patients were alive. The median follow-up time was 39 months (range, 4-106 months). After high-dose rate treatment, 3 of 89 patients showed systemic progress after a mean follow-up of 47 months (range, 19-75 months) and 2 patients had a different quadrant in-breast tumor after 27 and 35 months. One patient died 7 months after treatment of unknown causes. After pulse dose rate treatment, 1 of 45 patients had a local recurrence after 42 months and 1 patient died because of another cause after 13 months. We observed mild fibrosis in 27 breasts, telangiectasia in 6, hyperpigmentation in 14 cases, and keloid formation in 1.
Question: Is oncoplastic surgery a contraindication for accelerated partial breast radiation using the interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy method?
Thought: The context provided discusses the use of oncoplastic surgery followed by accelerated partial breast irradiation in patients with early breast cancer. Based on the information given, it does not indicate that oncoplastic surgery is a contraindication for accelerated partial breast radiation using the interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy method.
Action: Finish[No, oncoplastic surgery is not a contraindication for accelerated partial breast radiation using the interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy method]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: These preliminary results suggest the feasibility of multicatheter APBI after oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery in selected low-risk breast cancer patients; however, special attention to target volume definition is needed. Further prospective investigations with long follow-up are needed to define the real value of the procedure.

Relevant Context: To explore whether electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays can help improve prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in the TrialNet autoantibody-positive population.
TrialNet subjects who were positive for one or more autoantibodies (microinsulin autoantibody, GAD65 autoantibody [GADA], IA-2A, and ZnT8A) with available ECL-insulin autoantibody (IAA) and ECL-GADA data at their initial visit were analyzed; after a median follow-up of 24 months, 177 of these 1,287 subjects developed diabetes.
Univariate analyses showed that autoantibodies by radioimmunoassays (RIAs), ECL-IAA, ECL-GADA, age, sex, number of positive autoantibodies, presence of HLA DR3/4-DQ8 genotype, HbA1c, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measurements were all significantly associated with progression to diabetes. Subjects who were ECL positive had a risk of progression to diabetes within 6 years of 58% compared with 5% for the ECL-negative subjects (P<0.0001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were compared, with the base model including age, sex, OGTT measurements, and number of positive autoantibodies by RIAs. The model with positivity for ECL-GADA and/or ECL-IAA was the best, and factors that remained significantly associated with time to diabetes were area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide, fasting C-peptide, AUC glucose, number of positive autoantibodies by RIAs, and ECL positivity. Adding ECL to the Diabetes Prevention Trial risk score (DPTRS) improved the receiver operating characteristic curves with AUC of 0.83 (P<0.0001).
Question: Do Electrochemiluminescence Assays Improve Prediction of Time to Type 1 Diabetes in Autoantibody-Positive TrialNet Subjects?
Thought: The context provided discusses a study that analyzed the use of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays in predicting time to type 1 diabetes in TrialNet autoantibody-positive subjects. The study found that ECL positivity was significantly associated with progression to diabetes and that adding ECL to the Diabetes Prevention Trial risk score improved prediction accuracy.
Action: Finish[Yes, Electrochemiluminescence assays improve prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in autoantibody-positive TrialNet subjects.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: ECL assays improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.

Relevant Context: Minority patients with cancer experience worse control of their pain than do their white counterparts. This disparity may, in part, reflect more miscommunication between minority patients and their physicians. Therefore, we examined whether patient coaching could reduce disparities in pain control in a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.
Sixty-seven English-speaking adult cancer outpatients, including 15 minorities, with moderate pain over the prior 2 weeks were randomly assigned to the experimental (N = 34) or control group (N = 33). Experimental patients received a 20-minute individualized education and coaching session to increase knowledge of pain self-management, to redress personal misconceptions about pain treatment, and to rehearse an individually scripted patient-physician dialog about pain control. The control group received standardized information on controlling pain. Data on average pain (0-10 scale) were collected at enrollment and 2-week follow-up.
At enrollment, minority patients had significantly more pain than their white counterparts (6.0 vs 5.0, P = 0.05). At follow-up, minorities in the control group continued to have more pain (6.4 vs 4.7, P = 0.01), whereas in the experimental group, disparities were eliminated (4.0 vs 4.3, P = 0.71). The effect of the intervention on reducing disparities was significant (P = 0.04).
Question: Can patient coaching reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control?
Thought: The question is asking if patient coaching can reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control. Based on the context provided, it is clear that patient coaching was effective in reducing these disparities, as shown by the results of the study.
Action: Finish[Yes, patient coaching can reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Patient coaching offers promise as a means of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in pain control. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.

Relevant Context: To provide equality of cancer care to rural patients, Townsville Cancer Centre administers intensive chemotherapy regimens to rural patients with node-positive breast and metastatic colorectal cancers at the same doses as urban patients. Side-effects were usually managed by rural general practitioners locally.AIM: The aim is to determine the safety of this practice by comparing the profile of serious adverse events and dose intensities between urban and rural patients at the Townsville Cancer Centre.
A retrospective audit was conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal and node-positive breast cancers during a 24-month period. Fisher's exact test was used for analysis. Rurality was determined as per rural, remote and metropolitan classification.
Of the 121 patients included, 70 and 51 patients had breast and colon cancers respectively. The urban versus rural patient split among all patients, breast and colorectal cancer subgroups was 68 versus 53, 43 versus 27 and 25 versus 26 respectively. A total of 421 cycles was given with dose intensity of>95% for breast cancer in both groups (P>0.05). Rate of febrile neutropenia was 9.3% versus 7.4% (P = 0.56). For XELOX, rate of diarrhoea was 20% versus 19% (P = 0.66) and rate of vomiting was 20% versus 11% (P = 0.11). Only two patients were transferred to Townsville for admission. No toxic death occurred in either group.
Question: Is intensive chemotherapy safe for rural cancer patients?
Thought: The question is asking about the safety of intensive chemotherapy for rural cancer patients based on the context provided. The study conducted at the Townsville Cancer Centre compared the profile of serious adverse events and dose intensities between urban and rural patients. The results showed that there were no toxic deaths in either group, and the rates of febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, and vomiting were similar between urban and rural patients. Therefore, based on this information, intensive chemotherapy appears to be safe for rural cancer patients.
Action: Finish[Yes, intensive chemotherapy appears to be safe for rural cancer patients based on the study conducted at the Townsville Cancer Centre.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.

Relevant Context: All VLBW infants from January 2008 to December 2012 with positive blood culture beyond 72 hours of life were enrolled in a retrospective cohort study. Newborns born after June 2010 were treated with IgM-eIVIG, 250 mg/kg/day iv for three days in addition to standard antibiotic regimen and compared to an historical cohort born before June 2010, receiving antimicrobial regimen alone. Short-term mortality (i.e. death within 7 and 21 days from treatment) was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were: total mortality, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, periventricular leukomalacia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia at discharge.
79 neonates (40 cases) were enrolled. No difference in birth weight, gestational age or SNAP II score (disease severity score) were found. Significantly reduced short-term mortality was found in treated infants (22% vs 46%; p = 0.005) considering all microbial aetiologies and the subgroup affected by Candida spp. Secondary outcomes were not different between groups.
Question: Are IgM-enriched immunoglobulins an effective adjuvant in septic VLBW infants?
Thought: The context provided describes a study comparing the outcomes of VLBW infants with sepsis treated with IgM-enriched immunoglobulins in addition to antibiotics versus those treated with antibiotics alone. The results show significantly reduced short-term mortality in infants treated with IgM-eIVIG. Therefore, based on the study findings, IgM-enriched immunoglobulins can be considered an effective adjuvant in septic VLBW infants.
Action: Finish[Yes, IgM-enriched immunoglobulins are an effective adjuvant in septic VLBW infants]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: This hypothesis-generator study shows that IgM-eIVIG is an effective adjuvant therapy in VLBW infants with proven sepsis. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm this pilot observation.

Relevant Context: Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at different loci have been associated with breast cancer susceptibility, accounting for around 10% of the familial component. Recent studies have found direct associations between specific SNPs and breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Our aim was to determine whether validated susceptibility SNP scores improve the predictive ability of risk models in comparison/conjunction to other clinical/demographic information.
Female BRCA1/2 carriers were identified from the Manchester genetic database, and included in the study regardless of breast cancer status or age. DNA was extracted from blood samples provided by these women and used for gene and SNP profiling. Estimates of survival were examined with Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were fit in the separate BRCA datasets and in menopausal stages screening different combinations of clinical/demographic/genetic variables. Nonlinear random survival forests were also fit to identify relevant interactions. Models were compared using Harrell's concordance index (1 - c-index).
548 female BRCA1 mutation carriers and 523 BRCA2 carriers were identified from the database. Median Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival was 46.0 years (44.9-48.1) for BRCA1 carriers and 48.9 (47.3-50.4) for BRCA2. By fitting Cox models and random survival forests, including both a genetic SNP score and clinical/demographic variables, average 1 - c-index values were 0.221 (st.dev. 0.019) for BRCA1 carriers and 0.215 (st.dev. 0.018) for BRCA2 carriers.
Question: Can multiple SNP testing in BRCA2 and BRCA1 female carriers be used to improve risk prediction models in conjunction with clinical assessment?
Thought: The context provided discusses the use of SNP testing in BRCA1 and BRCA2 female carriers to improve risk prediction models alongside clinical assessment. The study aimed to determine if validated susceptibility SNP scores enhance the predictive ability of risk models. Based on the information given, it seems that multiple SNP testing in conjunction with clinical assessment can indeed be used to improve risk prediction models for BRCA1 and BRCA2 female carriers.
Action: Finish[Yes, multiple SNP testing in BRCA1 and BRCA2 female carriers can be used to improve risk prediction models in conjunction with clinical assessment.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Random survival forests did not yield higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.

Relevant Context: Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy (LITT) of rat brains is associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability changes. We address the question of whether LITT-induced locoregional disruption of the BBB could possibly allow a locoregional passage of chemotherapeutic agents into brain tissue to treat malignant glioma.STUDY DESIGN/
CD Fischer rats were subject to LITT of the left forebrain. Disruption of the BBB was analyzed using Evans blue and immunohistochemistry (IH). Animals were perfused with paclitaxel, and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to analyze the content of paclitaxel in brain and plasma samples.
LITT induces an opening of the BBB as demonstrated by locoregional extravasation of Evans blue, C3C, fibrinogen, and IgM. HPLC proved the passage of paclitaxel across the disrupted BBB.
Question: Locoregional opening of the rodent blood-brain barrier for paclitaxel using Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy: a new concept of adjuvant glioma therapy?
Thought: The question is asking about the potential use of Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy to open the blood-brain barrier for paclitaxel as a new concept of adjuvant glioma therapy. Based on the context provided, it is clear that this method has been shown to induce an opening of the BBB and allow the passage of paclitaxel into brain tissue for potential treatment of malignant glioma.
Action: Finish[Yes, Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy has been demonstrated to induce an opening of the blood-brain barrier, allowing the passage of paclitaxel into brain tissue as a new concept of adjuvant glioma therapy.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: LITT induces a locoregional passage of chemotherapeutic agents into the brain tissue. This is of potential interest for the treatment of brain tumors.

Relevant Context: The benefits of serologic screening for coeliac disease in asymptomatic individuals are debatable.AIM: To investigate dietary compliance, quality of life and bone mineral density after long-term treatment in coeliac disease patients found by screening in risk groups.
The study comprised 53 consecutive screen-detected coeliac patients diagnosed 14 years (median) ago. Dietary compliance was assessed by interview, 4-day food record and serology. Quality of life was evaluated by the Psychological General Well-Being and SF-36 questionnaires, gastrointestinal symptoms by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and bone mineral density by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Comparisons were made to 44 symptom-detected-treated coeliac patients, 110 non-coeliac subjects and the general population.
A total of 96% of screen-detected and 93% of symptom-detected coeliac patients adhered to a strict or fairly strict gluten-free diet. In screen-detected patients, quality of life and gastrointestinal symptoms were similar to those in symptom-detected patients or non-coeliac controls and bone mineral density was similar to that in the general population.
Question: Is coeliac disease screening in risk groups justified?
Thought: The context provided indicates that coeliac disease screening in risk groups led to high rates of dietary compliance, similar quality of life and gastrointestinal symptoms compared to symptom-detected patients, and normal bone mineral density. Based on this information, it seems that coeliac disease screening in risk groups is justified.
Action: Finish[Yes, coeliac disease screening in risk groups is justified]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Long-term dietary compliance in screen-detected patients was good. Quality of life and bone mineral density were comparable with those in non-coeliac subjects and the general population. Active screening in coeliac disease risk groups seems to be reasonable rather than harmful.

Relevant Context: To investigate the importance of loss of consciousness (LOC) in predicting neuropsychological test performance in a large sample of patients with head injury.
Retrospective comparison of neuropsychological test results for patients who suffered traumatic LOC, no LOC, or uncertain LOC.
Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The total number of patients included in this study was 383.
Neuropsychological test measures, including the visual reproduction, digit span, and logical memory subtests of the Wechsler memory scale (revised), the Trail Making test, Wisconsin Card Sorting test, Hopkins Verbal Learning test, Controlled Oral Word Association, and the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia test (GOAT).
No significant differences were found between the LOC, no LOC, or uncertain LOC groups for any of the neuropsychological measures used. Patients who had experienced traumatic LOC did not perform more poorly on neuropsychological testing than those with no LOC or uncertain LOC. All three groups demonstrated mildly decreased performance on formal tests of speed of information processing, attentional process, and memory.
Question: Does loss of consciousness predict neuropsychological decrements after concussion?
Thought: The context provided indicates that there were no significant differences in neuropsychological test performance between patients who experienced traumatic LOC, no LOC, or uncertain LOC. Therefore, loss of consciousness does not appear to predict neuropsychological decrements after a concussion.
Action: Finish[Loss of consciousness does not predict neuropsychological decrements after concussion]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The results of this study cast doubt on the importance of LOC as a predictor of neuropsychological test performance during the acute phase of recovery from mild traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychological testing procedures have been shown to be sensitive in measuring cognitive sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in athletes. The failure of this study to find any relationship between LOC and neuropsychological functioning in a large sample of patients with mild head trauma calls into question the assignment of primary importance to LOC in grading severity of concussion. This study also does not provide support for the use of guidelines that rely heavily on LOC in making return-to-play decisions. Continued research is necessary to determine the relative importance of markers of concussion in athletes.

Relevant Context: Men appear to benefit more from being married than women with respect to mortality in middle age. However, there is some uncertainty about gender differences in mortality risks in older individuals, widowed, divorced and single individuals and about the impact of living arrangements.
Longitudinal data with 1990 census records being linked to mortality data up to 2005 were used (Swiss National Cohort). The sample comprised all residents over age 44 years in Switzerland (n=2,440,242). All-cause mortality HRs for marital status and living arrangements were estimated by Cox regression for men and women and different age groups with adjustment for education and socio-professional category.
The benefit of being married was stronger for men than for women; however, mortality patterns were similar, with higher mortality in divorced and single individuals compared with widowed individuals (<80 years). After adjustment for living arrangements, the gender difference by marital status disappeared. Stratification by living arrangement revealed that mortality risks were highest for 45-64-year-old divorced (HR 1.72 (95% CI 1.67 to 1.76)) and single men (HR 1.67 (95% CI 1.63 to 1.71)) who lived alone. In women of the same age, the highest mortality risk was observed for those who were single and living with a partner (HR 1.70 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.82)). In older age groups, the impact of marital status decreased.
Question: Marital status, living arrangement and mortality: does the association vary by gender?
Thought: The question is asking if the association between marital status, living arrangement, and mortality varies by gender. Based on the context provided, it is clear that the benefit of being married is stronger for men than for women, but after adjusting for living arrangements, the gender difference disappears. Mortality patterns are similar, with higher mortality in divorced and single individuals compared to widowed individuals. Therefore, the association between marital status, living arrangement, and mortality does vary by gender.
Action: Finish[Yes, the association between marital status, living arrangement, and mortality does vary by gender.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Evaluation of living arrangements is crucial for identifying and explaining gender differences in mortality risks by marital status. The impact of living alone and living with a partner seems to be different in men and women.

Relevant Context: The brain-dead donor supply has become one of the criteria limiting the performance of heart transplantation. Conventional screening criteria are too limiting and exclude suitable heart donors. Echocardiography is now widely available and is a reliable tool to assess left ventricular dysfunction in brain-dead donors. Yet few data are available on the degree of left ventricular dysfunction where a transplantation is possible.
Fifty-five potential brain-dead heart donors (age 38 +/- 11 years) were prospectively evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before harvesting. Fractional area change (FAC) was used to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. Transplanted hearts were evaluated on the fifth postoperative day. The transplantation was considered a success if the recipient was alive, not retransplanted, without an assistance device or an epinephrine infusion of more than 1 mg/h and showed an ejection fraction above 40%.
Of the 55 potential heart donors, 20 exhibited an FAC of less than 50%. Forty hearts were harvested, 36 of which were successfully transplanted. Nine patients had an FAC below 50% (group H2) and 27 had an FAC over 50% (group H1). Four patients died: 2 from hemorrhage (FAC>50% in donors); 1 from right and one from left ventricular dysfunction (FAC<50% in donors). The FAC increased significantly from 51 +/- 15% to 57 +/- 11% in 18 hearts that underwent TEE in donors and afterwards in recipients. Overall actuarial survival was 86.2% versus 64.6% at 1 and 2 years in group H1 and group H2, respectively (p = NS).
Question: Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patients: are marginally acceptable hearts suitable for transplantation?
Thought: The question is asking whether marginally acceptable hearts, as determined by transesophageal echocardiography, are suitable for transplantation. Based on the context provided, it seems that some marginally acceptable hearts were successfully transplanted, leading to improved survival rates in recipients.
Action: Finish[Yes, marginally acceptable hearts, as determined by transesophageal echocardiography, were suitable for transplantation and led to improved survival rates in recipients.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.

Relevant Context: Infants referred to our institution with a final diagnosis of ARM were retrospectively reviewed between 2001 and 2009. The first cohort consisted of patients that were referred between November 2001 and November 2006 with the diagnosis of an ARM that had been delayed for more than 48 h. The second cohort was those referred between December 2006 and May 2009 with whom the diagnosis of ARM had not been made within 24 h of birth.
Nineteen infants were referred with delayed diagnosis of an ARM over the 7.5 years of the study. Of 44 patients referred to our institution between December 2006 and May 2009, diagnosis of an ARM was delayed more than 24 h in 14 (32%). There was no difference in gender, birth weight, prematurity, type of malformation or presence of associated anomalies between those with timely and delayed diagnosis of their ARM. A significantly greater proportion of those with a delayed diagnosis presented with obstructive symptoms (86% vs. 27%, P<0.001), including abdominal distension (57%) and delayed passage of meconium or stool (29%). Despite undergoing neonatal examination, the diagnosis of ARM was missed in 12 patients overall.
Question: Delayed diagnosis of anorectal malformations: are current guidelines sufficient?
Thought: The context provided discusses the delayed diagnosis of anorectal malformations in infants and the differences between timely and delayed diagnoses. The question asks if current guidelines are sufficient for this issue.
Action: Finish[No, current guidelines are not sufficient for the delayed diagnosis of anorectal malformations in infants based on the findings of the study.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Delayed diagnosis of an ARM appears to be common, occurring in approximately 32% of patients referred to our institution over the last 2.5 years. Current guidelines appear insufficient to ensure prompt diagnosis of ARM.

Relevant Context: The gender difference in prevalence and incidence rates of depression is one of the most consistent findings in psychiatric epidemiology. We sought to examine whether any gender differences in symptom profile might account for this difference in rates.
This study was a population-based 13-year follow-up survey of community-dwelling adults living in East Baltimore in 1981. Subjects were the continuing participants of the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program. Participants interviewed between 1993 and 1996 with complete data on depressive symptoms and covariates were included (n = 1727). We applied structural equations with a measurement model for dichotomous data (the MIMIC-multiple indicators, multiple causes-model) to compare symptoms between women and men, in relation to the nine symptom groups comprising the diagnostic criteria for major depression, adjusting for several potentially influential characteristics (namely, age, self-reported ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, and employment).
There were no significant gender differences in the self-report of depression symptoms even taking into account the higher level of depressive symptoms of women and the influence of other covariates. For example, women were no more likely to endorse sadness than were men, as evidenced by a direct effect coefficient that was not significantly different from the null [adjusted estimated direct effect of gender on report of sadness = 0.105, 95% confidence interval (-0.113, 0.323)].
Question: Are higher rates of depression in women accounted for by differential symptom reporting?
Thought: The context provided discusses a study that examined gender differences in symptom reporting related to depression. The study found that there were no significant gender differences in the self-report of depression symptoms, even when accounting for other factors. Therefore, higher rates of depression in women are not accounted for by differential symptom reporting.
Action: Finish[No, higher rates of depression in women are not accounted for by differential symptom reporting]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.

Relevant Context: To assess whether it is possible for an experienced laparoscopic surgeon to perform efficient laparoscopic myomectomy regardless of the size, number, and location of the myomas.
Prospective observational study (Canadian Task Force classification II-1).
Tertiary endoscopy center.
A total of 505 healthy nonpregnant women with symptomatic myomas underwent laparoscopic myomectomy at our center. No exclusion criteria were based on the size, number, or location of myomas.
Laparoscopic myomectomy and modifications of the technique: enucleation of the myoma by morcellation while it is still attached to the uterus with and without earlier devascularization.
In all, 912 myomas were removed in these 505 patients laparoscopically. The mean number of myomas removed was 1.85 +/- 5.706 (95% CI 1.72-1.98). In all, 184 (36.4%) patients had multiple myomectomy. The mean size of the myomas removed was 5.86 +/- 3.300 cm in largest diameter (95% CI 5.56-6.16 cm). The mean weight of the myomas removed was 227.74 +/- 325.801 g (95% CI 198.03-257.45 g) and median was 100 g. The median operating time was 60 minutes (range 30-270 minutes). The median blood loss was 90 mL (range 40-2000 mL). Three comparisons were performed on the basis of size of the myomas (<10 cm and>or=10 cm in largest diameter), number of myomas removed (<or=4 and>or=5 myomas), and the technique (enucleation of the myomas by morcellation while the myoma is still attached to the uterus and the conventional technique). In all these comparisons, although the mean blood loss, duration of surgery, and hospital stay were greater in the groups in which larger myomas or more myomas were removed or the modified technique was performed as compared with their corresponding study group, the weight and size of removed myomas were also proportionately larger in these groups. Two patients were given the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma in their histopathology and 1 patient developed a diaphragmatic parasitic myoma followed by a leiomyoma of the sigmoid colon. Six patients underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy 4 to 6 years after the surgery for recurrent myomas. One conversion to laparotomy occurred and 1 patient underwent open subtotal hysterectomy for dilutional coagulopathy.
Question: Laparoscopic myomectomy: do size, number, and location of the myomas form limiting factors for laparoscopic myomectomy?
Thought: The context provided discusses a study on laparoscopic myomectomy in which no exclusion criteria were based on the size, number, or location of myomas. The study found that while larger myomas, more myomas, and certain techniques may result in greater blood loss, longer surgery duration, and hospital stay, the weight and size of removed myomas were also proportionately larger in these cases. Additionally, only two patients were diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma, and one patient developed a parasitic myoma. Overall, the study suggests that experienced laparoscopic surgeons can perform efficient laparoscopic myomectomy regardless of the size, number, and location of the myomas.
Action: Finish[Size, number, and location of myomas do not form limiting factors for laparoscopic myomectomy]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Laparoscopic myomectomy can be performed by experienced surgeons regardless of the size, number, or location of the myomas.

Relevant Context: The use of a balloon expandable stent valve includes balloon predilatation of the aortic stenosis before valve deployment. The aim of the study was to see whether or not balloon predilatation is necessary in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI).
Sixty consecutive TAVI patients were randomized to the standard procedure or to a protocol where balloon predilatation was omitted.
There were no significant differences between the groups regarding early hemodynamic results or complication rates.
Question: Can predilatation in transcatheter aortic valve implantation be omitted?
Thought: The context provided discusses a study where patients were randomized to receive TAVI with or without balloon predilatation, and there were no significant differences in outcomes between the groups. This suggests that predilatation in transcatheter aortic valve implantation can be omitted without affecting outcomes.
Action: Finish[Yes, predilatation in transcatheter aortic valve implantation can be omitted without significant differences in outcomes.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon predilatation. The reduction in the number of pacing periods required may be beneficial for the patient.

Relevant Context: To estimate changes in uterine myoma volume during pregnancy.
Review of departmental electronic perinatal database and medical records. Canadian Task Force Classification II-3.
Obstetrical ultrasound unit in an academic tertiary care center.
One hundred-seven patients diagnosed with uterine myomas during pregnancy and who had two or more obstetrical ultrasounds in different periods of pregnancy.
We analyzed the change in volume of uterine myomas between the first half of pregnancy (up until 19 weeks), third quarter (20-30 weeks), and last quarter (31 weeks to term). The volume of largest uterine myoma was calculated using the formula Volume (mm3)=Pi/6x(length mm)x(width mm)x(height mm).
The mean age of the population was 31+/-6 years. Between the first and the second study periods, the percentage of uterine myomas that decreased in size was 55.1% (95% CI: 43-66), with a mean decrease in volume of 35%+/-4%; while the percentage of uterine myomas that enlarged was 44.9% (95% CI: 34-56), with a mean increase in volume of 69%+/-11%. Between the second and the third study periods, 75% (95% CI: 56-87) became smaller, with a mean decrease in volume of 30%+/-3%; while 25% (95% CI: 13-43) enlarged, with a mean increase in volume of 102%+/-62%.
Question: Volume change of uterine myomas during pregnancy: do myomas really grow?
Thought: The context provided discusses the changes in volume of uterine myomas during pregnancy based on ultrasound measurements. It shows that a significant percentage of myomas decreased in size during pregnancy, while others enlarged. This suggests that myomas do not always grow during pregnancy.
Action: Finish[Myomas do not always grow during pregnancy]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.

Relevant Context: We observed an endoscopic abnormally in a group of children with histological esophagitis. We termed this finding "vertical lines in esophageal mucosa" (VLEM). We examined the relationship between the presence of VLEM and significant histologic changes in esophageal mucosal biopsies.
Between January 1, 1992, and August 31, 1994, the senior author (JFF) performed 255 esophageal biopsies. The procedure reports, available endoscopic photographs, and histology reports were reviewed to establish the endoscopic and histologic appearance of the esophageal mucosa. Intraepithelial cells were counted in a blind review of 42 randomly selected biopsies.
The esophageal mucosa had a normal appearance on 160 endoscopic studies (Group 1) and VLEM were the only mucosal abnormalities in 41 endoscopies (Group 2). Histology was normal in 92 of 160 biopsies (57.5%) from Group 1, and 1 of 41 biopsies (2.4%) from Group 2. Most patients in Group 2 had eosinophilic esophagitis (34 of 41, 83%, specificity 0.85, sensitivity 0.5, p>0.001) which was of moderate to severe intensity (31 of 34, 91.2%, specificity 0.88, sensitivity 0.73, p<0.001).
Question: Vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM): a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children?
Thought: The question is asking whether vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM) are a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children. Based on the context provided, it seems that the presence of VLEM is associated with significant histologic changes in esophageal mucosal biopsies, particularly with eosinophilic esophagitis.
Action: Finish[Yes, vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM) are a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children, especially when associated with eosinophilic esophagitis.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Histology usually demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation when VLEM were present. VLEM may be a highly specific endoscopic feature of esophagitis in children.

Relevant Context: To evaluate the usefulness of half-dose contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography for depicting the abdominal aorta and its major branches.
A total of 72 consecutive patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups that underwent MR angiography after receiving different concentrations (original or diluted to 50%) and total amounts (single or half-dose) of gadolinium chelate injected at different rates (1 or 0.5 mL/second). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the abdominal aorta and of the common and external iliac arteries were calculated, and two blinded readers rated the respective image qualities.
The SNR and CNR of the abdominal aorta and the common iliac artery in the 0.5 mL/second groups were statistically significantly lower than those in the 1 mL/second groups. The differences in overall image quality across the four groups were not statistically significant.
Question: Is half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography sufficient for the abdominal aorta and pelvis?
Thought: The study compared different doses and concentrations of contrast agents for MR angiography of the abdominal aorta and its branches. The results showed that the image quality was not significantly different across the groups, suggesting that half-dose contrast-enhanced MR angiography is sufficient for visualizing the abdominal aorta and pelvis.
Action: Finish[Yes, half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography is sufficient for the abdominal aorta and pelvis.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.

Relevant Context: Arterial calcification is a significant cardiovascular risk factor in hemodialysis patients. A series of factors are involved in the process of arterial calcification; however, the relationship between malnutrition and arterial calcification is still unclear.
68 hemodialysis patients were enrolled in this study. Nutrition status was evaluated using modified quantitative subjective global assessment (MQSGA). Related serum biochemical parameters were measured. And the radial artery samples were collected during the arteriovenous fistula surgeries. Hematoxylin/eosin stain was used to observe the arterial structures while Alizarin red stain to observe calcified depositions and classify calcified degree. The expressions of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and matrix Gla protein (MGP) were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot methods.
66.18% hemodialysis patients were malnutrition. In hemodialysis patients, the calcified depositions were mainly located in the medial layer of the radial arteries and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP were both increased in the calcified areas. The levels of serum albumin were negatively associated with calcification score and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP. While MQSGA score, serum phosphorus and calcium × phosphorus product showed positive relationships with calcification score and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP.
Question: Malnutrition, a new inducer for arterial calcification in hemodialysis patients?
Thought: The context provided discusses a study involving hemodialysis patients and their nutrition status in relation to arterial calcification. The study found that a significant percentage of hemodialysis patients were malnourished, and there were correlations between malnutrition, serum biochemical parameters, and the expressions of certain proteins related to arterial calcification. Based on this information, it is likely that malnutrition can indeed be considered a new inducer for arterial calcification in hemodialysis patients.
Action: Finish[Yes, malnutrition can be considered a new inducer for arterial calcification in hemodialysis patients]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Malnutrition is prevalent in hemodialysis patients and is associated with arterial calcification and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP in calcified radial arteries. Malnutrition may be a new inducer candidate for arterial calcification in hemodialysis patients.

Relevant Context: To identify the features of PMR that may predict the duration of steroid therapy, the occurrence of relapses and the late development of GCA.
Prospective cohort study of 176 patients with PMR, followed up for 5 years. Baseline factors associated with the duration of steroids therapy were identified using Cox regression. Predictors of relapse and the late development of GCA were identified using binary logistic regression.
A total of 176 patients with PMR were included, of whom 124 stopped steroids within 5 years. The probability of stopping steroids within 5 years was independently reduced by an elevated plasma viscosity (PV) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.49; 95% CI 0.29, 0.82 for a PV>or = 2.00 mPa s compared with a PV<or = 1.80 mPa s; overall P = 0.024] and by starting treatment at>15 mg prednisolone (HR = 0.63; 95% CI 0.41, 0.97; P = 0.036). Either of these independently reduced the chances of stopping steroids within a given time interval between 27 and 51%. No significant predictors of relapse were identified. Predictors of late GCA on univariable analysis were female sex [odds ratio (OR) = 8.16; 95% CI 1.06, 63.13; P = 0.044], HLA-DRB1*0101 or -*0401 alleles (OR = 4.95; 95% CI 1.05, 23.34; P = 0.043), PV>or = 2.00 mPa s compared with PV<or = 1.80 mPa s (OR = 10.64; 95% CI 1.28, 88.38; P = 0.029) and initial prednisolone dose>15 mg (OR = 4.53; 95% CI 1.61, 12.79; P = 0.004).
Question: Can the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica be predicted at disease onset?
Thought: The context provided discusses a study on patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and identifies factors that may predict the duration of steroid therapy, relapses, and the late development of giant cell arteritis (GCA). The study found that certain factors like plasma viscosity, initial prednisolone dose, sex, and specific alleles were associated with these outcomes. Therefore, based on this information, it is possible to predict the prognosis of PMR at disease onset by considering these factors.
Action: Finish[Yes, the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica can be predicted at disease onset based on factors such as plasma viscosity, initial prednisolone dose, sex, and specific alleles.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.

Relevant Context: Some studies suggest that open access articles are more often cited than non-open access articles. However, the relationship between open access and citations count in a discipline such as intensive care medicine has not been studied to date. The present article analyzes the effect of open access publishing of scientific articles in intensive care medicine journals in terms of citations count.
We evaluated a total of 161 articles (76% being non-open access articles) published in Intensive Care Medicine in the year 2008. Citation data were compared between the two groups up until April 30, 2011. Potentially confounding variables for citation counts were adjusted for in a linear multiple regression model.
The median number (interquartile range) of citations of non-open access articles was 8 (4-12) versus 9 (6-18) in the case of open access articles (p=0.084). In the highest citation range (>8), the citation count was 13 (10-16) and 18 (13-21) (p=0.008), respectively. The mean follow-up was 37.5 ± 3 months in both groups. In the 30-35 months after publication, the average number (mean ± standard deviation) of citations per article per month of non-open access articles was 0.28 ± 0.6 versus 0.38 ± 0.7 in the case of open access articles (p=0.043). Independent factors for citation advantage were the Hirsch index of the first signing author (β=0.207; p=0.015) and open access status (β=3.618; p=0.006).
Question: Does open access publishing increase the impact of scientific articles?
Thought: The context provided discusses a study on the impact of open access publishing on scientific articles in the field of intensive care medicine. The study found that open access articles had a higher citation count compared to non-open access articles, indicating that open access publishing does increase the impact of scientific articles.
Action: Finish[Yes, open access publishing increases the impact of scientific articles]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Open access publishing and the Hirsch index of the first signing author increase the impact of scientific articles. The open access advantage is greater for the more highly cited articles, and appears in the 30-35 months after publication.

Relevant Context: Precursor events are undesirable events that can lead to a subsequent adverse event and have been associated with postoperative mortality. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether precursor events are associated with a composite endpoint of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (death, acute renal failure, stroke, infection) in a low- to medium-risk coronary artery bypass grafting, valve, and valve plus coronary artery bypass grafting population. These events might be targets for strategies aimed at quality improvement.
The present study was a retrospective cohort design performed at the Queen Elizabeth Health Science Centre. Low- to medium-risk patients who had experienced postoperative MACE were matched 1:1 with patients who had not experienced postoperative MACE. The operative notes, for both groups, were scored by 5 surgeons to determine the frequency of 4 precursor events: bleeding, difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, repair or regrafting, and incomplete revascularization or repair. A univariate comparison of ≥1 precursor events in the matched groups was performed.
A total of 311 MACE patients (98.4%) were matched. The primary outcome occurred more frequently in the MACE group than in the non-MACE group (33% vs 24%; P = .015). The incidence of the individual events of bleeding and difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass was significantly higher in the MACE group. Those patients with a precursor event in the absence of MACE also appeared to have a greater prevalence of other important postoperative outcomes.
Question: Are intraoperative precursor events associated with postoperative major adverse events?
Thought: The context provided discusses a study that aimed to determine if intraoperative precursor events are associated with postoperative major adverse events. Based on the information given, it seems that there is indeed an association between precursor events and postoperative major adverse events.
Action: Finish[Yes, intraoperative precursor events are associated with postoperative major adverse events.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery who are exposed to intraoperative precursor events were more likely to experience a postoperative MACE. Quality improvement techniques aimed at mitigating the consequences of precursor events might improve the surgical outcomes for cardiac surgical patients.

Relevant Context: Ultrasound is currently not established for the diagnosis of fractures. The aim of this study was to compare ultrasound and X-ray beyond their use solely for the identification of fractures, i. e., for the detection of fracture type and dislocation for pediatric fracture diagnosis.
Limb bones of dead young pigs served as a model for pediatric bones. The fractured bones were examined with ultrasound, X-ray, and CT, which served as the gold standard.
162 of 248 bones were fractured. 130 fractures were identified using ultrasound, and 148 using X-ray. There were some advantages of X-ray over ultrasound in the detection of fracture type (80 correct results using X-ray, 66 correct results using ultrasound). Ultrasound, however, was superior to X-ray for dislocation identification (41 correct results using X-ray, 51 correct results using ultrasound). Both findings were not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing.
Question: Is ultrasound equal to X-ray in pediatric fracture diagnosis?
Thought: The context provided indicates that ultrasound and X-ray were compared for pediatric fracture diagnosis. While X-ray had some advantages in detecting fracture type, ultrasound was superior in identifying dislocations. However, both findings were not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing, suggesting that ultrasound is not equal to X-ray in pediatric fracture diagnosis.
Action: Finish[Ultrasound is not equal to X-ray in pediatric fracture diagnosis]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Ultrasound not only has comparable sensitivity to that of X-ray for the identification of limb fractures but is also equally effective for the diagnosis of fracture type and dislocation. Thus, ultrasound can be used as an adequate alternative method to X-ray for pediatric fracture diagnosis.

Relevant Context: An effective advance care planning programme involves an organizational wide commitment and preparedness for health service reform to embed advance care planning into routine practice. Internationally, such programmes have been implemented predominantly in aged and acute care with more recent work in primary care.
A multi-site action research was conducted over a 16-month period in 2007-2009 with three Victorian community palliative care services. Using mixed method data collection strategies to assess feasibility, we conducted a baseline audit of staff and clients; analysed relevant documents (client records, policies, procedures and quality improvement strategies) pre-implementation and post-implementation and conducted key informant interviews (n = 9).
Three community palliative care services: one regional and two metropolitan services in Victoria, Australia.
The services demonstrated that it was feasible to embed the Model into their organizational structures. Advance care planning conversations and involvement of family was an important outcome measure rather than completion rate of advance care planning documents in community settings. Services adapted and applied their own concept of community, which widened the impact of the model. Changes to quality audit processes were essential to consolidate the model into routine palliative care practice.
Question: Is an advance care planning model feasible in community palliative care?
Thought: The context provided indicates that a multi-site action research was conducted with three community palliative care services in Victoria, Australia, showing that it was feasible to embed the advance care planning model into their organizational structures. Advance care planning conversations and involvement of family were important outcomes, and services adapted the model to fit their own concept of community. Therefore, based on this information, it can be concluded that an advance care planning model is feasible in community palliative care.
Action: Finish[Yes, an advance care planning model is feasible in community palliative care]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: An advance care planning model is feasible for community palliative care services. Quality audit processes are an essential component of the Model with documentation of advance care planning discussion established as an important outcome measure.

Relevant Context: The goal of this retrospective study was to assess whether 99mTc-white blood cell (WBC) scintigraphy and upper gastrointestinal small bowel follow-through (UGI-SBFT) could exclude inflammation in children suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Of a population of 313 children who had a 99mTc-WBC scan, 130 children were studied exclusively to rule out IBD. Sixty-nine colonoscopies with biopsies were done within a short time interval of the 99mTc-WBC scans. There were also 51 controls studied with 99mTc-WBC scintigraphy.
Of the 130 children studied to exclude IBD, the final diagnosis was Crohn's disease in 27, ulcerative colitis in nine, miscellaneous colitis in 13, probably normal in 42, and normal in 39. The 99mTc-WBC scans were positive in all but three newly diagnosed Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or miscellaneous colitis children. The false-negative 99mTc-WBC studies were seen in children with mild inflammation on biopsies and normal UGI-SBFT studies. In the 46 children with a true-positive 99mTc-WBC scan, 81% (17/21) of UGI-SBFT studies were normal. In five children with equivocal UGI-SBFT studies, the 99mTc-WBC scan correctly predicted if inflammation was present in the terminal ileum.
Question: Are 99mTc leukocyte scintigraphy and SBFT studies useful in children suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease?
Thought: The question is asking about the usefulness of 99mTc leukocyte scintigraphy and SBFT studies in children with suspected inflammatory bowel disease. Based on the context provided, it seems that these studies are indeed useful in diagnosing IBD in children.
Action: Finish[Yes, 99mTc leukocyte scintigraphy and SBFT studies are useful in children suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Our results suggest that 99mTc-WBC is useful as an initial screening modality to exclude IBD, and is more sensitive than UGI-SBFT studies.

Relevant Context: Individuals with type 1 diabetes have a high risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, and it has been reported that they consume a high atherogenic diet. We examined how nutrient intake and adherence to current European nutritional recommendations evolved in a large cohort of European individuals with type 1 diabetes over a period of 7 years.SUBJECTS/
We analysed data from the EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study, a European multicentre prospective cohort study. Standardized 3-day dietary records were employed in individuals with type 1 diabetes. One thousand one hundred and two patients (553 men, 549 women, baseline age 33 ± 10 years, duration 15 ± 9 years) had complete nutritional data available at baseline and after 7 years. We calculated mean differences in reported nutrients over time and adjusted these for age, gender, HbA1c and BMI with ANOVA models.
Compared to baseline, there were minor changes in nutrients. Reported protein (-0.35% energy (en), fat (-1.07% en), saturated fat (-0.25% en) and cholesterol (-7.42 mg/1000 kcal) intakes were lower, whereas carbohydrate (+1.23% en) and fibre (+0.46 g/1000 kcal) intakes were higher at the 7-year follow-up. European recommendations for adequate nutrient intakes were followed in individuals with type 1 diabetes for protein (76% at baseline and 78% at follow-up), moderately for fat (34, 40%), carbohydrate (34, 41%) and cholesterol (39, 47%), but poorly for fibre (1.4, 2.4%) and saturated fat (11, 13%).
Question: Do European people with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet?
Thought: The context provided states that individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet, as reported in the study.
Action: Finish[Yes, individuals with type 1 diabetes in Europe have been reported to consume a high atherogenic diet.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.

Relevant Context: Digoxin is a commonly used medication for heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias that has recently been suggested as a novel chemotherapeutic agent. Preclinical studies of prostate cancer (PCa) have shown anti-tumor activity with digoxin. We explore the relationship between use of digoxin and PCa risk.
Data from a population-based case-control study of incident cases aged 35-74 years at PCa diagnosis in 2002-2005 in King County, Washington were available. Controls were identified by random digit dialing and frequency matched by age. Use of digoxin was determined from in-person questionnaires regarding medical and prescription history. The relationship of digoxin use with PCa risk was evaluated with logistic regression.
One thousand one cases of PCa and 942 controls were analyzed. The prevalence of digoxin use in controls was 2.7%, and use was positively correlated with age. In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, race, PSA screening, and family history of PCa, digoxin use was associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of PCa (OR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.30-1.10). Among those with ≥3 PSA tests over the preceding 5 years (546 cases, 380 controls), digoxin use was associated with a stronger reduction of PCa risk (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.20-0.98).
Question: Is digoxin use for cardiovascular disease associated with risk of prostate cancer?
Thought: The context provided indicates that digoxin use was evaluated in relation to prostate cancer risk. The data suggests that digoxin use is associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of prostate cancer, especially in individuals who had undergone multiple PSA tests.
Action: Finish[No, digoxin use for cardiovascular disease is associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of prostate cancer, especially in individuals who had undergone multiple PSA tests.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: These data indicate digoxin use may be associated with a reduction in risk of PCa. Given the potential mechanisms by which digoxin may exert an anti-neoplastic effect and other recent studies showing a negative association between digoxin use and PCa, further research is warranted.

Relevant Context: Studies examining predictors of survival among the oldest-old have primarily focused on objective measures, such as physical function and health status. Only a few studies have examined the effect of personality traits on survival, such as optimism. The aim of this study was to examine whether an optimistic outlook predicts survival among the oldest-old.
The Danish 1905 Cohort Survey is a nationwide, longitudinal survey comprising all individuals born in Denmark in 1905. At baseline in 1998, a total of 2,262 persons aged 92 or 93 agreed to participate in the intake survey. The baseline in-person interview consisted of a comprehensive questionnaire including physical functioning and health, and a question about whether the respondent had an optimistic, neutral or pessimistic outlook on his or her own future.
During the follow-up period of 12 years (1998-2010) there were 2,239 deaths (99 %) in the 1905 Cohort Survey. Univariable analyses revealed that optimistic women and men were at lower risk of death compared to their neutral counterparts [HR 0.82, 95 % CI (0.73-0.93) and 0.81, 95 % CI (0.66-0.99), respectively]. When confounding factors such as baseline physical and cognitive functioning and disease were taken into account the association between optimism and survival weakened in both sexes, but the general pattern persisted. Optimistic women were still at lower risk of death compared to neutral women [HR 0.85, 95 % CI (0.74-0.97)]. The risk of death was also decreased for optimistic men compared to their neutral counterparts, but the effect was non-significant [HR 0.91, 95 % CI (0.73-1.13)].
Question: Optimism and survival: does an optimistic outlook predict better survival at advanced ages?
Thought: The question is asking whether an optimistic outlook predicts better survival at advanced ages. Based on the context provided, it is clear that an optimistic outlook does predict better survival among the oldest-old.
Action: Finish[Yes, an optimistic outlook does predict better survival at advanced ages among the oldest-old]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: An optimistic outlook appears to be a significant predictor of survival among the oldest-old women. It may also be a significant predictor for men but the sample size is small.

Relevant Context: To compare the dose intensity and toxicity profiles for patients undergoing chemotherapy at the Townsville Cancer Centre (TCC), a tertiary cancer centre in northern Queensland, with those for patients treated in Mount Isa, supervised by the same medical oncologists via teleoncology.
A quasi-experimental design comparing two patient groups.
TCC and Mount Isa Hospital, which both operate under the auspices of the Townsville Teleoncology Network (TTN).
Eligible patients who received chemotherapy at TCC or Mt Isa Hospital between 1 May 2007 and 30 April 2012.
Teleoncology model for managing cancer patients in rural towns.
Dose intensity (doses, number of cycles and lines of treatment) and toxicity rates (rate of serious side effects, hospital admissions and mortality).
Over 5 years, 89 patients received a total of 626 cycles of various chemotherapy regimens in Mount Isa. During the same period, 117 patients who received a total of 799 cycles of chemotherapy at TCC were eligible for inclusion in the comparison group. There were no significant differences between the Mount Isa and TCC patients in most demographic characteristics, mean numbers of treatment cycles, dose intensities, proportions of side effects, and hospital admissions. There were no toxicity-related deaths in either group.
Question: Do teleoncology models of care enable safe delivery of chemotherapy in rural towns?
Thought: The context provided describes a study comparing the delivery of chemotherapy in rural towns using a teleoncology model. Based on the results presented, it seems that the teleoncology model enabled safe delivery of chemotherapy in both Mount Isa and TCC, with no significant differences in toxicity rates, hospital admissions, or mortality between the two groups.
Action: Finish[Yes, teleoncology models of care enable safe delivery of chemotherapy in rural towns based on the study results comparing TCC and Mount Isa Hospital.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: It appears safe to administer chemotherapy in rural towns under the supervision of medical oncologists from larger centres via teleoncology, provided that rural health care resources and governance arrangements are adequate.

Relevant Context: To examine the ability of various postoperative nomograms to predict prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and to validate that they could predict aggressive biochemical recurrence (BCR). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), grade, and stage are the classic triad used to predict BCR after radical prostatectomy (RP). Multiple nomograms use these to predict risk of BCR. A previous study showed that several nomograms could predict aggressive BCR (prostate-specific antigen doubling time [PSADT] <9 months) more accurately than BCR. However, it remains unknown if they can predict more definitive endpoints, such as PCSM.
We performed Cox analyses to examine the ability of 4 postoperative nomograms, the Duke Prostate Center (DPC) nomogram, the Kattan postoperative nomogram, the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) nomogram, and the joint Center for Prostate Disease Research(CPDR)/Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) nomogram to predict BCR and PCSM among 1778 men in the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database who underwent RP between 1990 and 2009. We also compared their ability to predict BCR and aggressive BCR in a subset of men. We calculated the c-index for each nomogram to determine its predictive accuracy for estimating actual outcomes.
We found that each nomogram could predict aggressive BCR and PCSM in a statistically significant manner and that they all predicted PCSM more accurately than they predicted BCR (ie, with higher c-index values).
Question: Do nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) do a better job of predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR?
Thought: The context provided indicates that the nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) were able to predict more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes, such as prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), more accurately than they predicted BCR itself.
Action: Finish[Yes, nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) were able to predict more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes, such as prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), more accurately than they predicted BCR itself.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Currently available nomograms used to predict BCR accurately predict PCSM and other more clinically relevant endpoints. Moreover, not only do they significantly predict PCSM, but do so with generally greater accuracy than BCR.

Relevant Context: The accepted treatment protocol for necrotizing fasciitis (NF) consists of extensive surgery and wide spectrum antibiotics. Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) has been recommended as adjuvant therapy for NF, improving patient mortality and outcome. However, the beneficial effect of HBO for NF remains controversial.
A retrospective evaluation of treatment outcome in 37 patients treated for NF between 1984 and 1993 was carried out. The mortality rate, morbidity criteria, and risk factors for grave prognosis were compared between a group of 25 patients who received HBO as part of their treatment protocol and a group of the remaining 12 patients treated by surgical excision and antibiotics alone.
The two groups were found to be similar with regard to age, gender, the incidence of individual risk factors for ominous prognosis, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score for disease's severity on presentation. The mortality rate among the HBO-treated patients was 36%, as opposed to 25% in the non-HBO group. The mean number of surgical débridements required per patient was significantly higher in the HBO group: 3.3 compared with 1.5 in the non-HBO-treated patients. Although the average length of hospitalization for survivors was shorter for the HBO group, the difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance.
Question: Necrotizing fasciitis: an indication for hyperbaric oxygenation therapy?
Thought: The question is asking whether hyperbaric oxygenation therapy is indicated for necrotizing fasciitis based on the context provided. The study showed that while HBO treatment did not significantly reduce mortality rates, it did require more surgical procedures per patient. The difference in hospitalization length was not statistically significant.
Action: Finish[Not a clear indication for hyperbaric oxygenation therapy for necrotizing fasciitis based on the study results]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.

Relevant Context: This study examined changes in the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies by U.S. adults aged 18 years or older with chronic disease-related functional limitations between 2002 and 2007.
The study was a cross-sectional survey.SETTING/
The study was conducted in the United States.
The study comprised adults aged 18 years or older with chronic disease-related functional limitations.
Data were obtained from the 2002 and 2007 U.S. National Health Interview Survey to compare the use of 22 CAM therapies (n=9313 and n=7014, respectively). Estimates were age adjusted to the year 2000 U.S. standard population.
The unadjusted and age-standardized prevalence of overall CAM use (22 therapies comparable between both survey years) was higher in 2007 than in 2002 (30.6% versus 26.9%, p<0.001 and 34.4% versus 30.6%, p<0.001, respectively). Adults with functional limitations that included changing and maintaining body position experienced a significant increase in CAM use between 2002 and 2007 (31.1%-35.0%, p<0.01). The use of deep breathing exercises was the most prevalent CAM therapy in both 2002 and 2007 and increased significantly during this period (from 17.9% to 19.9%, p<0.05). The use of meditation, massage, and yoga also increased significantly from 2002 and 2007 (11.0%-13.5%, p<0.01; 7.0%-10.9%, p<0.0001; and 5.1% to 6.6%, p<0.05, respectively), while the use of the Atkins diet decreased (2.2%- 1.4%, p<0.01).
Question: Has the use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies by U.S. adults with chronic disease-related functional limitations changed from 2002 to 2007?
Thought: The question is asking about changes in the use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies by U.S. adults with chronic disease-related functional limitations between 2002 and 2007. Based on the context provided, I can see that the overall CAM use increased from 26.9% in 2002 to 30.6% in 2007, with specific therapies like deep breathing exercises, meditation, massage, and yoga also showing significant increases during this period.
Action: Finish[Yes, the use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies by U.S. adults with chronic disease-related functional limitations increased from 2002 to 2007, with overall CAM use and specific therapies like deep breathing exercises, meditation, massage, and yoga showing significant increases.]

Relevant Context: The objective of the current study is to determine to what extent the reduction of Chile's traffic fatalities and injuries during 2000-2012 was related to the police traffic enforcement increment registered after the introduction of its 2005 traffic law reform.
A unique dataset with assembled information from public institutions and analyses based on ordinary least square and robust random effects models was carried out. Dependent variables were traffic fatality and severe injury rates per population and vehicle fleet. Independent variables were: (1) presence of new national traffic law; (2) police officers per population; (3) number of traffic tickets per police officer; and (4) interaction effect of number of traffic tickets per police officer with traffic law reform. Oil prices, alcohol consumption, proportion of male population 15-24 years old, unemployment, road infrastructure investment, years' effects and regions' effects represented control variables.
Empirical estimates from instrumental variables suggest that the enactment of the traffic law reform in interaction with number of traffic tickets per police officer is significantly associated with a decrease of 8% in traffic fatalities and 7% in severe injuries. Piecewise regression model results for the 2007-2012 period suggest that police traffic enforcement reduced traffic fatalities by 59% and severe injuries by 37%.
Question: Did Chile's traffic law reform push police enforcement?
Thought: The context provided indicates that the study found a significant association between the enactment of Chile's traffic law reform and the increase in police traffic enforcement with a decrease in traffic fatalities and severe injuries. Therefore, it can be concluded that Chile's traffic law reform did push police enforcement.
Action: Finish[Yes, Chile's traffic law reform did push police enforcement]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Findings suggest that traffic law reforms in order to have an effect on both traffic fatality and injury rates reduction require changes in police enforcement practices. Last, this case also illustrates how the diffusion of successful road safety practices globally promoted by WHO and World Bank can be an important influence for enhancing national road safety practices.

Relevant Context: Several atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) are used as second-line agents for treatment resistant depression. AAPs can be expensive compared to other treatment options and can cause several side effects.
To estimate healthcare costs and utilization of AAPs compared to other second-line agents.
Observational study using Medicaid claims data (2006-2011). Subjects were depression-diagnosed adult members with at least two prescriptions of antidepressant medications followed by a second-line agent. Gamma generalized linear models (GLM) produced estimates of the difference in mean expenditures among treatment groups after adjusting for individual baseline characteristics using propensity scores. Negative binomial models produced estimates of the difference in number of hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits.
A total of 3910 members received second-line treatment. Treatment groups were AAPs (n = 2211), augmentation agents other than AAPs (n = 1008), and antidepressant switching (n = 691). AAPs resulted in higher mean adjusted pharmacy costs and higher mean adjusted total mental health-related costs. Mean adjusted total healthcare costs and number of inpatient and ED visits were not different among treatments.
Question: Does the use of atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive therapy in depression result in cost savings?
Thought: The study compared the healthcare costs and utilization of atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) to other second-line agents in the treatment of depression. Based on the results provided, it seems that the use of AAPs did not result in cost savings compared to other treatment options.
Action: Finish[No, the use of atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive therapy in depression did not result in cost savings compared to other second-line agents.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The results show no evidence that AAPs used as second-line treatment for depression results in overall cost savings or lower inpatient and ED visits compared to other treatment strategies.

Relevant Context: Low intakes or blood levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA + DHA) are independently associated with increased risk of death from coronary heart disease (CHD). In randomized secondary prevention trials, fish or fish oil have been demonstrated to reduce total and CHD mortality at intakes of about 1 g/day. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid (FA) composition reflects long-term intake of EPA + DHA. We propose that the RBC EPA + DHA (hereafter called the Omega-3 Index) be considered a new risk factor for death from CHD.
We conducted clinical and laboratory experiments to generate data necessary for the validation of the Omega-3 Index as a CHD risk predictor. The relationship between this putative marker and risk for CHD death, especially sudden cardiac death (SCD), was then evaluated in several published primary and secondary prevention studies.
The Omega-3 Index was inversely associated with risk for CHD mortality. An Omega-3 Index of>or = 8% was associated with the greatest cardioprotection, whereas an index of<or = 4% was associated with the least.
Question: The Omega-3 Index: a new risk factor for death from coronary heart disease?
Thought: The context provided discusses the Omega-3 Index as a potential new risk factor for death from coronary heart disease. Based on the information given, it is clear that the Omega-3 Index is indeed being proposed as a new risk factor for death from CHD.
Action: Finish[Yes, the Omega-3 Index is being proposed as a new risk factor for death from coronary heart disease.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The Omega-3 Index may represent a novel, physiologically relevant, easily modified, independent, and graded risk factor for death from CHD that could have significant clinical utility.

Relevant Context: To compare the accuracy achieved by a trained urology nurse practitioner (UNP) and consultant urologist in detecting bladder tumours during flexible cystoscopy.
Eighty-three patients underwent flexible cystoscopy by both the UNP and consultant urologist, each unaware of the other's findings. Before comparing the findings, each declared whether there was tumour or any suspicious lesion requiring biopsy.
Of 83 patients examined by flexible cystoscopy, 26 were found to have a tumour or a suspicious lesion. One tumour was missed by the UNP and one by the urologist; each tumour was minute. Analysis using the chance-corrected proportional agreement (Kappa) was 0.94, indicating very close agreement.
Question: The nurse cystoscopist: a feasible option?
Thought: Based on the context provided, it seems that the nurse cystoscopist is a feasible option for detecting bladder tumors during flexible cystoscopy.
Action: Finish[Yes, the nurse cystoscopist is a feasible option based on the high agreement level with the consultant urologist in detecting bladder tumors during flexible cystoscopy.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: A UNP can be trained to perform cystoscopy and detect suspicious lesions as accurately as can a consultant urologist. Legal and training issues in implementation are important.

Relevant Context: Sternal fractures in childhood are rare. The aim of the study was to investigate the accident mechanism, the detection of radiological and sonographical criteria and consideration of associated injuries.
In the period from January 2010 to December 2012 all inpatients and outpatients with sternal fractures were recorded according to the documentation.
A total of 4 children aged 5-14 years with a sternal fracture were treated in 2 years, 2 children were hospitalized for pain management and 2 remained in outpatient care.
Question: Sternal fracture in growing children : A rare and often overlooked fracture?
Thought: The context provided indicates that sternal fractures in childhood are indeed rare.
Action: Finish[True]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Isolated sternal fractures in childhood are often due to typical age-related traumatic incidents. Ultrasonography is a useful diagnostic tool for fracture detection and radiography is the method of choice for visualization of the extent of the dislocation.

Relevant Context: To examine the clinical effect (efficacy and tolerability) of high doses of zonisamide (ZNS) (>500 mg/d) in adult patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy.
Between 2006 and 2013, all epileptic outpatients treated with high doses of ZNS were selected. Safety and efficacy were assessed based on patient and caregiver reports. Serum levels of ZNS and other concomitant antiepileptic drugs were evaluated if available.
Nine patients (5 female): 8 focal/1 generalized pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Mean age: 34 years. Most frequent seizure type: complex partial seizures; other seizure types: generalized tonic-clonic, tonic, myoclonia. Zonisamide in polytherapy in all (100%), administered in tritherapy in 3 (33%) of 9 patients; mean dose: 633 (600-700) mg/d; efficacy (>50% seizure reduction) was observed in 5 (55%) of 9 patients. Five of 9 patients are still taking high doses of ZNS (more than 1 year). Adverse events were observed in 3 (37%) of 8 patients. Good tolerance to high doses of other antiepileptic drugs had been observed in 6 (66%) of 9 patients. Plasma levels of ZNS were only available in 2 patients; both were in the therapeutic range (34.95, 30.91) (10-40 mg/L).
Question: Could Adult European Pharmacoresistant Epilepsy Patients Be Treated With Higher Doses of Zonisamide?
Thought: The context provided describes a study where adult patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy were treated with high doses of zonisamide, showing some efficacy and tolerability. Based on this information, it seems that adult European pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients could potentially be treated with higher doses of zonisamide, as it has shown some positive results in this study.
Action: Finish[Yes, adult European pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients could potentially be treated with higher doses of zonisamide based on the positive efficacy and tolerability observed in the study mentioned.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.

Relevant Context: The use of three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound may help to determine the exact position of the needle during breast biopsy, thereby reducing the number of core samples that are needed to achieve a reliable histological diagnosis. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of 3D ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy (LCNB) of the breast.
A total of 360 core needle biopsies was obtained from 169 breast lesions in 146 patients. Additional open breast biopsy was performed in 111 women (127/169 breast lesions); the remaining 42 lesions were followed up for at least 24 months. 3D ultrasound visualization of the needle in the postfiring position was used to classify the biopsy as central, marginal or outside the lesion. Based on this classification it was decided whether another sample had to be obtained.
A median of two core samples per lesion provided for all the lesions a sensitivity for malignancy of 96.9%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0% and false-negative rate of 3.1%, and for the excised lesions a sensitivity of 96.5%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0%, false-negative rate of 3.5% and an underestimation rate of 3.4%.
Question: Three-dimensional ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy: is it a reliable method for the histological assessment of breast lesions?
Thought: The context provided discusses the efficacy of three-dimensional ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy for histological assessment of breast lesions. Based on the results mentioned, it seems that this method is indeed reliable for accurately diagnosing breast lesions.
Action: Finish[Yes, three-dimensional ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy is a reliable method for the histological assessment of breast lesions.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 3D ultrasound validation of the postfiring needle position is an efficient adjunct to ultrasound-guided LCNB. The advantages of 3D ultrasound validation are likely to include a reduction in the number of core samples needed to achieve a reliable histological diagnosis (and a possible reduction in the risk of tumor cell displacement), reduced procedure time and lower costs.

Relevant Context: The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of ultrasonography to confirm Schanz pin placement in a cadaveric model, and the interobserver repeatability of the ultrasound methodology.
This investigation is a repeated measures cadaveric study with multiple examiners.
Cadaveric preparation and observations were done by an orthopaedic traumatologist and resident, and two general surgery traumatologists.
A total of 16 Schanz pins were equally placed in bilateral femora and tibiae. Four examiners took measurements of pin protrusion beyond the distal cortices using first ultrasonography and then by direct measurement after gross dissection.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Distal Schanz pin protrusion length measurements from both ultrasonography and direct measurement post dissection.
Schanz pin protrusion measurements are underestimated by ultrasonography (p<0.01) by an average of 10 percent over the range of 5 to 18 mm, and they display a proportional bias that increases the under reporting as the magnitude of pin protrusion increases. Ultrasound data demonstrate good linear correlation and closely represent actual protrusion values in the 5 to 12 mm range. Interobserver repeatability analysis demonstrated that all examiners were not statistically different in their measurements despite minimal familiarity with the ultrasound methodology (p>0.8).
Question: Is portable ultrasonography accurate in the evaluation of Schanz pin placement during extremity fracture fixation in austere environments?
Thought: The question is asking about the accuracy of portable ultrasonography in evaluating Schanz pin placement during extremity fracture fixation in austere environments. Based on the context provided, the study found that ultrasonography underestimates Schanz pin protrusion measurements by an average of 10 percent over a certain range, but displays good linear correlation and closely represents actual protrusion values in a specific range. Additionally, interobserver repeatability analysis showed that all examiners were not statistically different in their measurements despite minimal familiarity with the ultrasound methodology.
Action: Finish[Yes, portable ultrasonography is accurate in the evaluation of Schanz pin placement during extremity fracture fixation in austere environments, as it demonstrates good linear correlation and closely represents actual protrusion values within a specific range.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Despite the statistical imparity of pin protrusion measurement via ultrasound compared to that of gross dissection, a consideration of the clinical relevance of ultrasound measurement bias during an austere operating theatre leads to the conclusion that ultrasonography is an adequate methodology for Schanz pin protrusion measurement.

Relevant Context: Beating-heart valve surgery appears to be a promising technique for protection of hypertrophied hearts. Normothermic normokalemic simultaneous antegrade/retrograde perfusion (NNSP) may improve myocardial perfusion. However, its effects on myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism remain unclear. The present study was to determine whether NNSP improved myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism of hypertrophied hearts relative to normothermic normokalemic antegrade perfusion (NNAP).
Twelve hypertrophied pig hearts underwent a protocol consisting of three 20-minute perfusion episodes (10 minutes NNAP and 10 minutes NNSP in a random order) with each conducted at a different blood flow in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD [100%, 50%, and 20% of its initial control]). Myocardial oxygenation was assessed using near-infrared spectroscopic imaging. Myocardial energy metabolism was monitored using localized phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
With 100% LAD flow, both NNAP and NNSP maintained myocardial oxygenation, adenosine triphosphate, phosphocreatine, and inorganic phosphate at normal levels. When LAD flow was reduced to 50% of its control level, NNSP resulted in a small but significant decrease in myocardial oxygenation and phosphocreatine, whereas those measurements did not change significantly during NNAP. With LAD flow further reduced to 20% of its control level, both NNAP and NNSP caused a substantial decrease in myocardial oxygenation, adenosine triphosphate, and phosphocreatine with an increase in inorganic phosphate. However, the changes were significantly greater during NNSP than during NNAP.
Question: Does normothermic normokalemic simultaneous antegrade/retrograde perfusion improve myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism for hypertrophied hearts?
Thought: The question is asking whether normothermic normokalemic simultaneous antegrade/retrograde perfusion improves myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism for hypertrophied hearts. Based on the context provided, it is clear that NNSP does not consistently improve myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism compared to NNAP, especially at lower levels of blood flow in the left anterior descending coronary artery.
Action: Finish[NNSP does not consistently improve myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism for hypertrophied hearts compared to NNAP, especially at lower levels of blood flow in the left anterior descending coronary artery.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Normothermic normokalemic simultaneous antegrade/retrograde perfusion did not improve, but slightly impaired myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism of beating hypertrophied hearts relative to NNAP. Therefore, NNSP for protection of beating hypertrophied hearts during valve surgery should be used with extra caution.

Relevant Context: The study was performed to evaluate the clinical and technical efficacy of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) of small saphenous varicosities, particularly in relation to the site of endovenous access.
Totally 59 patients with unilateral saphenopopliteal junction incompetence and small saphenous vein reflux underwent EVLA (810 nm, 14 W diode laser) with ambulatory phlebectomies. Small saphenous vein access was gained at the lowest site of truncal reflux. Patients were divided into 2 groups: access gained above mid-calf (AMC, n = 33) and below mid-calf (BMC, n = 26) levels. Outcomes included Venous Clinical Severity Scores (VCSS), Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), patient satisfaction, complications, and recurrence rates.
Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in VCSS, AVVQ, generic quality of life Short Form 36, and EuroQol scores (P<.05) up to 1 year. No differences were seen between AMC and BMC groups for complications (phlebitis: 2 [6%] and 1 [3.8%], P>.05; paresthesia: 2 [6%] and 5 [19%], P = .223) and recurrence (3 [9%] and 1 [3.8%], P = .623), respectively.
Question: Endovenous laser ablation in the treatment of small saphenous varicose veins: does site of access influence early outcomes?
Thought: The question is asking if the site of access for endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) in the treatment of small saphenous varicose veins influences early outcomes. Based on the context provided, it seems that there were no significant differences in outcomes between the groups with access gained above mid-calf (AMC) and below mid-calf (BMC) levels.
Action: Finish[No, the site of access did not influence early outcomes]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The site of access in our study does not appear to influence complications specifically neural injury or recurrence rates.

Relevant Context: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is undiagnosed in approximately half of the patients actually suffering from the disease. In addition, the prevalence of DM is more than twice as high as in patients with periodontitis when compared to periodontally healthy subjects. Thus, a high number of patients with periodontitis may have undiagnosed DM. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether blood oozing from a gingival crevice during routine periodontal examination can be used for determining glucose levels.
Observational cross-sectional studies were carried out in 75 patients (43 males and 32 females) with chronic periodontitis who were divided into two groups: Group I and Group II, respectively. Blood oozing from the gingival crevices of anterior teeth following periodontal probing was collected with the stick of glucose self-monitoring device, and the blood glucose levels were measured. At the same time, finger-prick blood was taken for glucometric analysis and subsequent readings were recorded.
The patient's blood glucose values ranged from 74 to 256 mg/dl. The comparison between gingival crevicular blood and finger-prick blood showed a very strong correlation, with a t value of 3.97 (at P value = 0.001).
Question: Can gingival crevicular blood be relied upon for assessment of blood glucose level?
Thought: The context provided indicates that there is a strong correlation between blood glucose levels measured from gingival crevicular blood and finger-prick blood. This suggests that gingival crevicular blood can be relied upon for the assessment of blood glucose levels.
Action: Finish[Yes, gingival crevicular blood can be relied upon for the assessment of blood glucose levels]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The data from this study has shown that GCB collected during diagnostic periodontal examination can be an excellent source of blood for glucometric analysis.

Relevant Context: In a prospective study 218 preschool children were enrolled (stratified in 2 training programs, one specialized for phonologic awareness in order to prevent dyslexia, the other consisting in training of general perception) during the last year of kindergarten. After finishing the first grade 131 children were compared in their reading and writing abilities.
In the whole group only a slight difference was found between both training modalities concerning their writing abilities. However, children with a history of hearing loss, actual hearing loss or pathologic middle ear findings profited most from the specialized training program compared to the control in their reading abilities.
Question: Is a specialised training of phonological awareness indicated in every preschool child?
Thought: The context indicates that children with a history of hearing loss, actual hearing loss, or pathologic middle ear findings benefited most from the specialized training program in reading abilities. Therefore, a specialized training of phonological awareness may not be indicated in every preschool child, but rather in those with specific risk factors such as hearing issues.
Action: Finish[No, a specialized training of phonological awareness is not indicated in every preschool child, but rather in those with specific risk factors such as hearing issues.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: A specialized training program to improve phonologic awareness as a basis for reading and writing in every kindergarten and preschool child seems to be unnecessary. However, children with temporary hearing deficits benefit from such a program. For all other children general perception training may be sufficient.

Relevant Context: To explore whether early treatment would shorten the duration of headache from headache onset to its peak and reduce headache severity at peak.
Prior clinical studies almost exclusively focused on headache relief after dosing. No data are available on whether early intervention affects the duration from headache onset to peak and headache severity at peak.
Adult migraineurs were enrolled in this observational study from multi-site headache clinics. Patients recorded their migraine experiences via an electronic diary over 1 month. Patients reported the time and pain severity at onset, dosing, and peak. We used a linear mixed model to evaluate the impact of the timing of treatment and to adjust for covariates and correlation of observations within subjects.
A total of 182 patients reported 970 migraine episodes, 620 of which were treated before headaches progressed to peak. Mean time from headache onset to peak varied from 1.9 hours to 8.9 hours for patients treated within 15 minutes of onset and those who waited for 4 or more hours, respectively. However, early intervention was not associated with reduced headache severity at peak. In multivariate analysis, early treatment, use of triptans, and mild migraine headache in the past 3 months were significantly associated with shorter time from onset to headache peak. A separate model indicated that the timing of medication was not associated with the duration between dosing and headache peak, but use of triptans shortened the time from dosing to headache peak.
Question: Does early migraine treatment shorten time to headache peak and reduce its severity?
Thought: The context provided indicates that early treatment for migraines was associated with a shorter time from headache onset to peak, but it was not linked to reduced headache severity at peak. Triptans and mild migraine headache history were factors significantly associated with a shorter time to headache peak.
Action: Finish[Yes, early migraine treatment shortens time to headache peak but does not reduce its severity at peak. Triptans and mild migraine headache history were factors significantly associated with a shorter time to headache peak.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Early treatment and use of triptans may lead to shorter duration from migraine headache onset to its peak but did not alleviate headache severity at peak. This could result in decreased migraine burden by reducing total migraine headache duration.

Relevant Context: Research on stroke survivors' driving safety has typically used either self-reports or government records, but the extent to which the 2 may differ is not known. We compared government records and self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions in a sample of stroke survivors.
The 56 participants were originally recruited for a prospective study on driving and community re-integration post-stroke; the study population consisted of moderately impaired stroke survivors without severe communication disorders who had been referred for a driving assessment. The driving records of the 56 participants for the 5 years before study entry and the 1-year study period were acquired with written consent from the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), Canada. Self-reports of collisions and convictions were acquired via a semistructured interview and then compared with the MTO records.
Forty-three participants completed the study. For 7 (13.5%) the MTO records did not match the self-reports regarding collision involvement, and for 9 (17.3%) the MTO records did not match self-reports regarding driving convictions. The kappa coefficient for the correlation between MTO records and self-reports was 0.52 for collisions and 0.47 for convictions (both in the moderate range of agreement). When both sources of data were consulted, up to 56 percent more accidents and up to 46 percent more convictions were identified in the study population in the 5 years before study entry compared to when either source was used alone.
Question: Department of Transportation vs self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors: do they agree?
Thought: The question is asking about the agreement between Department of Transportation records and self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors. Based on the context provided, there is moderate agreement between the two sources of data, with discrepancies found in a significant percentage of cases.
Action: Finish[Moderate agreement between Department of Transportation records and self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.

Relevant Context: All currently available atypical antipsychotics have, at clinically relevant doses: i) high serotonin (5-HT)2 occupancy; ii) greater 5-HT2 than dopamine (D)2 occupancy; and iii) a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects when their D2 occupancy exceeds 80%. A review of pharmacologic and behavioral data suggested that amoxapine should also conform to this profile; therefore, we undertook a positron-emission tomography (PET) study of its 5-HT2 and D2 occupancy.
Seven healthy volunteers received 50-250 mg/day of amoxapine for 5 days and then had [11C]-raclopride and [18F]-setoperone PET scans.
5-HT2 receptors showed near saturation at doses of 100 mg/day and above. The D2 receptor occupancies showed a dose-dependent increase, never exceeding 80%; at all doses 5-HT2 occupancy exceeded D2 occupancy.
Question: Is amoxapine an atypical antipsychotic?
Thought: Based on the context provided, amoxapine conforms to the profile of atypical antipsychotics with high serotonin (5-HT)2 occupancy, greater 5-HT2 than dopamine (D)2 occupancy, and a lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects when D2 occupancy is below 80%. Therefore, amoxapine can be classified as an atypical antipsychotic.
Action: Finish[Yes, amoxapine is an atypical antipsychotic]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an "atypical" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.

Relevant Context: Optimization of the preoperative hemoglobin (Hb) level is an effective way to reduce allogeneic transfusion in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) though the procedure is expensive, requires close monitoring and is often inconvenient for patients with reduced mobility. Our aim was to investigate the value of preoperative Hb levels to predict transfusion and thereby tailoring Hb optimization to patient characteristics.
All consecutive patients who undergone primary TKA in our center over 2 years, and received tranexamic acid intraoperatively, were reviewed. The adjusted association between preoperative Hb levels and transfusion was assessed by multivariate logistic regression, and the estimated probability of transfusion for individual patients was derived from the logistic model.
Out of the 784 patients who meet the inclusion criteria, risk of transfusion was associated with poorer performance status, as measured by the America Association of Anestesiology (ASA) score III/IV (OR: 3·3, P < 0·001) and lower preoperative Hb level (OR 3·8 for each g/dl below 13 g/dl; P < 0·001). According to the Hb level, the estimated probability of transfusion was 0·03 (range: 0·03-0·64) for ASA I/II patients and 0·10 (range: 0·10-0·84) for ASA III/IV.
Question: Should all patients be optimized to the same preoperative hemoglobin level to avoid transfusion in primary knee arthroplasty?
Thought: The context provided indicates that the risk of transfusion is associated with lower preoperative Hb levels. Therefore, tailoring Hb optimization to patient characteristics, such as performance status, is important in predicting transfusion. This suggests that not all patients should be optimized to the same preoperative hemoglobin level to avoid transfusion in primary knee arthroplasty.
Action: Finish[Tailoring Hb optimization to patient characteristics is important in predicting transfusion, so not all patients should be optimized to the same preoperative hemoglobin level in primary knee arthroplasty.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Not all the patients undergoing TKA who receive tranexamic acid need the same preoperative Hb optimization target. Two easily available factors, such as the ASA score and the Hb level, can help individualize the Hb optimization target.

Relevant Context: Treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus in children with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) depends on the level of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) block. Air-encephalography is regarded as the gold standard for differentiating communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus. Since air-encephalography involves a lumbar puncture, it carries the risk of cerebral herniation. AIM. The aim of this study was to determine whether communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus in TBM can be differentiated by means of cranial computerised tomography (CT).
A number of CT indices were measured in 50 children with communicating and 34 children with non-communicating hydrocephalus according to air-encephalographic findings.
The only CT finding that correlated with the type of hydrocephalus was the shape of the third ventricle. Significantly more children with non-communicating hydrocephalus had a rounded third ventricle than those with communicating hydrocephalus.
Question: Can CT predict the level of CSF block in tuberculous hydrocephalus?
Thought: The question is asking if CT can predict the level of CSF block in tuberculous hydrocephalus. Based on the context provided, it seems that CT findings, specifically the shape of the third ventricle, can differentiate between communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus, but it may not be able to predict the exact level of CSF block.
Action: Finish[CT findings can differentiate between communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus in tuberculous meningitis, but may not predict the exact level of CSF block.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: CT is therefore not useful in determining the level of CSF block in TBM. Air-encephalography remains the most reliable way of determining the level of CSF obstruction.

Relevant Context: Stock et al. (Eur Respir J 25:47-53, 2005) recently estimated asthma prevalence in Germany using claims data on prescriptions and hospital diagnoses and found high prevalence peaks in infants. Our objective was to critically assess and discuss various aspects of identifying children with asthma using prescription data.
We replicated the selection procedure of Stock et al. using data on 290,919 children aged 0-17 years insured in the Gmünder ErsatzKasse (GEK) in 2005. Asthma prevalence was also estimated in a sample of 17,641 children aged 0-17 years participating in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) from 2003 to 2006.
In children aged 0-4 years insured in the GEK, prevalences were found to range from 11.7 to 17.7% for boys and from 7.2 to 11.1% for girls when the criteria of Stock et al. were applied. A steady decline in prevalences was observed in older age groups. Asthma prevalence estimated in the KiGGS data showed a quite different distribution. In the age group 0-4 years, prevalences were found to range from 0 to 2.6% in boys and from 0 to 1.0% in girls; in children>4 years, prevalences were found to increase with increasing age.
Question: Prescriptions as a proxy for asthma in children: a good choice?
Thought: Prescriptions as a proxy for asthma in children may not be a good choice based on the context provided. The study found high asthma prevalence peaks in infants using prescription data, but the estimates from another source showed a different distribution. This suggests that using prescriptions alone may not accurately reflect asthma prevalence in children.
Action: Finish[Prescriptions as a proxy for asthma in children may not be a good choice for accurately estimating asthma prevalence, as shown by the differing results between the study using prescription data and the estimates from another source.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: When additional validation studies were taken into account, asthma medications were found to be prescribed not only for asthma but also for other respiratory diseases. In addition, not all children with current asthma had prescriptions. We therefore conclude that asthma medications are therefore not a good proxy for the disease.

Relevant Context: The seafaring industry remains a hazardous occupation that requires sophisticated systems of risk and fitness assessment. This study aims to investigate the extent of agreement between Approved Doctors (ADs) and Medical Referees (MRs) when they assess a seafarer's fitness.
Between 2003 and 2009 a total of 232,878 seafarer medical examinations were carried out by ADs, of which 465 were considered by the MRs because the seafarer appealed against the AD's decision. The extent of agreement between ADs and MRs was studied.
Two hundred and sixty-eight (58%) cases seen by the ADs were classed as category 4 "permanently unfit"; the referees only placed 85 (18%) of them in this category. On the other hand, 252 (54%) cases seen by the MRs were classed as category 2 "fit with restrictions", while the ADs had only placed 111 (24%) in this category. The overall agreement between the assessors (AD vs. MR) was poor (Kappa K = 0.18).
For cardiovascular diseases and for mental ill-health, access to additional information by the MR was the commonest reason for changing the fitness category, but for all other conditions factors such as the experience and knowledge of the MRs or their different interpretation of the standards were the most frequent reasons for a change to fitness category or to restrictions.
Question: Do approved doctors and medical referees in the UK agree when assessing a seafarer's fitness?
Thought: The context provided indicates that there is poor agreement between Approved Doctors (ADs) and Medical Referees (MRs) when assessing a seafarer's fitness.
Action: Finish[No, there is poor agreement between Approved Doctors (ADs) and Medical Referees (MRs) when assessing a seafarer's fitness.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: This study found that there was poor agreement between the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons for this are considered.

Relevant Context: The main treatment for rectal carcinoma is surgery. Preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) is advocated to reduce local recurrence and improve resection of mid and low tethered rectal tumors.
Fifty-two patients with mid or low rectal tumors underwent CRT (external beam radiation plus 5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid). Patients who had low rectal tumors with complete response (CR) were not submitted to surgical treatment. All other patients were submitted to surgery, independently of the response. Mean follow-up was 32.1 months.
Five-year overall survival was 60.5%. Clinical evaluation after CRT showed CR in 10 cases (19.2%), all low tumors; incomplete response (>50%) in 21 (40.4%); and no response (<50%) in 19 (36.6%). Among the 10 cases with CR, 8 presented with local recurrence within 3.7 to 8.8 months. Two patients were not submitted to surgery and are still alive without cancer after 37 and 58 months. Thirty-nine patients had radical surgery. Seven had local recurrences after CRT plus surgery (17.9%). Overall survival was negatively affected by lymph node metastases (P =.017) and perineural invasion (P =.026).
Question: Chemoradiation instead of surgery to treat mid and low rectal tumors: is it safe?
Thought: The context provided indicates that patients with low rectal tumors who had a complete response (CR) to chemoradiation were not submitted to surgical treatment. However, among the cases with CR, 8 out of 10 presented with local recurrence. This suggests that opting for chemoradiation instead of surgery for low rectal tumors may not be entirely safe, as local recurrence occurred in a significant number of cases.
Action: Finish[Opting for chemoradiation instead of surgery for mid and low rectal tumors may not be entirely safe, as local recurrence occurred in a significant number of cases with complete response to chemoradiation.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Exclusive CRT approach is not safe to treat patients with low infiltrative rectal carcinoma.

Relevant Context: Compared with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) may have additional value in the assessment of primary and recurrent cervical cancer. However, the degree of tumour uptake of (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose (FDG) uptake is sometimes influenced by diabetes mellitus (DM). Therefore, we conducted this prospective study to compare the diagnostic ability of FDG-PET in patients with cervical cancer complicated by DM and those without DM.
Patients with untreated locally advanced primary or clinically curable recurrent cervical carcinoma were enrolled. Both FDG-PET and MRI/CT scans were performed within 2 weeks. Patients were categorised into the following groups: hyperglycaemic DM (fasting blood sugar>126 mg/dl), euglycaemic DM and non-DM. The lesions were confirmed histologically or by clinical follow-up. The receiver operating characteristic curve method, with calculation of the area under the curve (AUC), was used to evaluate the discriminative power.
From February 2001 to January 2003, 219 patients (75 with primary and 144 with recurrent cervical cancer) were eligible for analysis. Sixteen had hyperglycaemic DM, 12 had euglycaemic DM and 191 were in the non-DM group. The diagnostic power of PET in the hyperglycaemic DM, euglycaemic DM and non-DM groups did not differ significantly with regard to the identification of either metastatic lesions (AUC, 0.967/0.947/0.925, P>0.05) or primary tumours/local recurrence (AUC, 0.950/0.938/0.979, P>0.05). Considering all DM patients, PET showed a significantly higher detection power than MRI/CT scans in respect of metastatic lesions (AUC=0.956 vs 0.824, P=0.012).
Question: Does diabetes mellitus influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer?
Thought: The context provided indicates that diabetes mellitus (DM) may influence the degree of tumour uptake of FDG in patients with cervical cancer. However, the study results show that the diagnostic power of FDG-PET did not differ significantly between patients with hyperglycaemic DM, euglycaemic DM, and those without DM in identifying metastatic lesions or primary tumors/local recurrence. Additionally, PET showed a significantly higher detection power than MRI/CT scans in detecting metastatic lesions in all DM patients.
Action: Finish[Diabetes mellitus does not significantly influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: In comparison with its accuracy in non-DM patients, the accuracy of PET in cervical cancer patients with mild to moderate DM was not significantly reduced.

Relevant Context: Being unmarried is a well-known risk factor for poor pregnancy outcome such as preterm delivery and intrauterine growth restriction. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the prevalence and risk of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and selected bacteria isolated from the lower genital tract and to determine the socioeconomic and microbiological characteristics that might be responsible for poor pregnancy outcome observed among unmarried pregnant women.
The study population comprised 196 pregnant women attending 10 randomly selected outpatient maternity units in the Lodz region, central Poland. Cervicovaginal samples were obtained between 8 and 16 weeks of gestation. Based on Spiegel's criteria, gram-stained vaginal smears were examined for BV and the BV-associated flora was sought by culture. To evaluate the risk factors, relative risk ratios were calculated using EPI INFO software.
Among 196 pregnant women, 40 (20.4%) were unmarried. BV was diagnosed among 55 (28.1%) women studied. In the univariate analysis, unmarried pregnant women were characterized by younger age, primary educational level, poor economic situation and excessive smoking during pregnancy, as compared to married women. The unmarried status was a borderline risk factor for BV (OR = 1.83, 95% CI 0.94-4.9) after adjustment for age, smoking and education. An analysis of the microbiological culture from the lower genital tract revealed that unmarried pregnant women had a higher risk for several types of pathological microflora, as compared to married women. However, this finding was significant only for Mycoplasma hominis. The independent risk factors of M. hominis were the young age of the subject and a low concentration of Lactobacillus spp.
Question: Do microbiological factors account for poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland?
Thought: The context provided indicates that microbiological factors, specifically the presence of Mycoplasma hominis, are associated with poor pregnancy outcomes among unmarried pregnant women in Poland.
Action: Finish[Yes, microbiological factors, particularly the presence of Mycoplasma hominis, are associated with poor pregnancy outcomes among unmarried pregnant women in Poland.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The observed socioeconomic, demographic and microbiological differences between unmarried and married women could be responsible for the poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. Unmarried pregnant women should be covered by comprehensive medical care even before pregnancy. Further studies taking into account the role of psychological stress, patterns of sexual behavior and substance abuse during pregnancy could help identify the factors responsible for adverse pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women.

Relevant Context: To study the relationship between lunar position and the day of delivery; to investigate the synodic distribution of spontaneous deliveries, especially in relation to the presence of a full moon.
Retrospective analysis of 1248 spontaneous full-term deliveries in three-year period (36 lunar months), setted at Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Civil Hospital, Fano (Marche, Italy), using circular statistics techniques.
A connection between the distribution of spontaneous full-term deliveries and the lunar month was found. The effect of the phases of the moon seems to be particularly relevant in multiparae and plurigravidae; in these cases, the mean day of delivery corresponds to the first or second day after the full moon.
Question: Does lunar position influence the time of delivery?
Thought: The context provided indicates that there is a connection between lunar position and the time of delivery, especially in multiparae and plurigravidae. This suggests that lunar position does influence the time of delivery.
Action: Finish[Yes, lunar position does influence the time of delivery, particularly in multiparae and plurigravidae.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: In this paper the effect of lunar phases on the time of delivery is shown. This influence seems to be especially relevant in the case of multiparae and plurigravidae. Nevertheless, it is too weak to allow for prediction regarding the days with the highest frequency of deliveries.

Relevant Context: To ascertain whether hospital type is associated with differences in total cost and outcomes for inpatient tonsillectomy.
Cross-sectional analysis of the 2006, 2009, and 2012 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID).
Children ≤18 years of age undergoing tonsillectomy with/without adenoidectomy were included. Risk-adjusted generalized linear models assessed for differences in hospital cost and length of stay (LOS) among children managed by (1) non-children's teaching hospitals (NCTHs), (2) children's teaching hospitals (CTHs), and (3) nonteaching hospitals (NTHs). Risk-adjusted logistic regression compared the odds of major perioperative complications (hemorrhage, respiratory failure, death). Models accounted for clustering of patients within hospitals, were weighted to provide national estimates, and controlled for comorbidities.
The 25,685 tonsillectomies recorded in the KID yielded a national estimate of 40,591 inpatient tonsillectomies performed in 2006, 2009, and 2012. The CTHs had significantly higher risk-adjusted total cost and LOS per tonsillectomy compared with NCTHs and NTHs ($9423.34/2.8 days, $6250.78/2.11 days, and $5905.10/2.08 days, respectively; P<.001). The CTHs had higher odds of complications compared with NCTHs (odds ratio [OR], 1.48; 95% CI, 1.15-1.91; P = .002) but not when compared with NTHs (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89-1.59; P = .23). The CTHs were significantly more likely to care for patients with comorbidities (P<.001).
Question: Inpatient Pediatric Tonsillectomy: Does Hospital Type Affect Cost and Outcomes of Care?
Thought: The question is asking about the impact of hospital type on the cost and outcomes of inpatient pediatric tonsillectomy. Based on the context provided, it is evident that children's teaching hospitals (CTHs) had significantly higher total cost and length of stay per tonsillectomy compared to non-children's teaching hospitals (NCTHs) and nonteaching hospitals (NTHs). Additionally, CTHs had higher odds of complications compared to NCTHs.
Action: Finish[Children's teaching hospitals (CTHs) had significantly higher total cost and length of stay per tonsillectomy compared to non-children's teaching hospitals (NCTHs) and nonteaching hospitals (NTHs). Additionally, CTHs had higher odds of complications compared to NCTHs.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Significant differences in costs, outcomes, and patient factors exist for inpatient tonsillectomy based on hospital type. Although reasons for these differences are not discernable using isolated claims data, findings provide a foundation to further evaluate patient, institutional, and system-level factors that may reduce cost of care and improve value for inpatient tonsillectomy.

Relevant Context: Medical records of 220 patients hospitalized for acute diverticulitis between June 1, 2002 and September 1, 2009 were reviewed. Acute diverticulitis was diagnosed by clinical criteria and characteristic CT findings. Fifteen patients were excluded either because of questionable CT or hematochezia. Mean age was 61.8±14.3 years (61% females). Clinical parameters, laboratory results, imaging, endoscopic and histopathological reports, and long-term patients' outcome were analyzed.
One hundred patients (aged 61.8±13.3 y, 54.1% females), underwent an early (4 to 6 wk) colonoscopy after hospital discharge. There were no significant differences in patients' characteristics or survival between those with or without colonoscopy (4±1.9 vs. 4.2±2.1 y, P=0.62). No colonic malignancy was detected. However, in 32 patients (32%) at least 1 polyp was found. Only 1 was determined as an advanced adenoma. No new or different diagnosis was made after colonoscopy.
Question: Does a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis affect its management?
Thought: The context provided indicates that patients who underwent a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis did not show significant differences in characteristics or survival compared to those who did not have a colonoscopy. Additionally, no colonic malignancy was detected, and only a small percentage of patients had polyps, with only one being an advanced adenoma. Therefore, based on this information, it seems that a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis may not significantly affect its management.
Action: Finish[Colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis may not significantly affect its management]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be reevaluated.

Relevant Context: To provide insight into the factors by which obesity in itself may directly lead to early arterial damage, we aimed to determine early sonographic markers of obesity-related vascular dysfunction in young obese males.
Thirty-five young obese males and 23 age-matched healthy male volunteers were recruited into the study. Common carotid artery pulsatility index and resistance index were calculated from blood flow velocities curves obtained by pulsed Doppler ultrasonography.
The mean pulsatility index, resistance index, body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, plasma fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were statistically higher in obese subjects than in healthy controls.
Question: Are increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes early signs of vascular abnormalities in young obese males?
Thought: The context provided indicates that the study aimed to determine early sonographic markers of obesity-related vascular dysfunction in young obese males, including the calculation of carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes. The results showed that these indexes were higher in obese subjects compared to healthy controls. Therefore, increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes can be considered early signs of vascular abnormalities in young obese males.
Action: Finish[Yes, increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes are early signs of vascular abnormalities in young obese males.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Our results suggest that depressed vessel compliance and increased vascular resistance are features of young, obese, normotensive subjects independently of and in addition to cardiovascular risk factors. As changes in arterial wall properties may be incipient in young obese subjects, future studies will be required to demonstrate whether early intervention such as diet and exercise in this population can improve vascular functions.

Relevant Context: To investigate whether problems in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) can add to conventionally used clinical measurements in helping to predict a diagnosis of dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up.
Multicenter prospective cohort study.
Memory clinics in Europe.
Individuals aged 55 and older without dementia.
IADLs were measured using pooled activities from five informant-based questionnaires. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the relation between IADLs and dementia. Age, sex, education, depression, and cognitive measures (Mini-Mental State Examination and verbal memory) were included in the model.
Five hundred thirty-one participants had baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments; 69 (13.0%) of these had developed dementia at 1-year follow-up. At 2-year follow-up, 481 participants were seen, of whom 100 (20.8%) had developed dementia. Participants with IADL disabilities at baseline had a higher conversion rate (24.4%) than participants without IADL disabilities (16.7%) (chi-square = 4.28, degrees of freedom = 1, P = .04). SEM showed that IADL disability could help predict dementia in addition to the measured variables at 1-year follow-up (odds ratio (OR) = 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.51-3.13) and 2-year follow-up (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.33-3.33).
Question: Do instrumental activities of daily living predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up?
Thought: The context provided indicates that instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) can help predict dementia at both 1- and 2-year follow-up based on the results of the study.
Action: Finish[Yes, instrumental activities of daily living predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: IADL disability is a useful addition to the diagnostic process in a memory clinic setting, indicating who is at higher risk of developing dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up.

Relevant Context: The present study investigated factors that explain when and why different groups of teammates are more likely to request and accept backup from one another when needed in an environment characterized by extreme time pressure and severe consequences of error: commercial air traffic control (ATC).
Transactive memory theory states that teammates develop consensus regarding the distribution of their relative expertise as well as confidence in that expertise over time and that this facilitates coordination processes. The present study investigated whether this theory could help to explain between-team differences in requesting and accepting backup when needed.
The present study used cross-sectional data collected from 51 commercial ATC teams. Hypotheses were tested using multiple regression analysis.
Teammates with greater experience working together requested and accepted backup from one another more than those with lesser experience working together. Teammate knowledge consensus and perceived team efficacy appear to have mediated this relationship.
Question: Do familiar teammates request and accept more backup?
Thought: The context provided suggests that teammates with greater experience working together are more likely to request and accept backup from one another. This is likely due to the development of consensus regarding expertise distribution and confidence in that expertise over time, as explained by transactive memory theory.
Action: Finish[Yes, familiar teammates with greater experience working together are more likely to request and accept backup from one another.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Transactive memory theory extends to high-stress environments in which members' expertise is highly overlapping. Teammates' shared mental models about one another increase the likelihood that they will request and accept backup.

Relevant Context: Despite the advantages from using aromatase inhibitors (AIs) compared with tamoxifen for early breast cancer, an unexpectedly greater number of grade 3 and 4 cardiovascular events (CVAE) (as defined by National Cancer Institute of Canada-Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0] was demonstrated.
Phase 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing AI with tamoxifen in early breast cancer were considered eligible for this review. The event-based risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were derived, and a test of heterogeneity was applied. Finally, absolute differences (ADs) in event rates and the number of patients needed to harm 1 patient (NNH) were determined.
Seven eligible RCTs (19,818 patients) reported CVAE results. When considering all RCTs, the AD of the primary endpoint (CVAE) between the 2 arms (0.52%), tamoxifen versus AI, was statistically significant (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.07-1.60; P= .007). This translated into an NNH value of 189 patients; when only third-generation AIs were considered, the difference (0.57%) remained significant (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.09-1.63; P= .0038). Thromboembolic events were significantly more frequent in the tamoxifen arm, regardless of the strategy adopted (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.42-0.65; P<.0001), without significant heterogeneity (P= .21). An AD of 1.17% and an NNH value of 85 patients were observed.
Question: Do adjuvant aromatase inhibitors increase the cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer?
Thought: The question is asking about the cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer when using adjuvant aromatase inhibitors. Based on the context provided, it is clear that adjuvant aromatase inhibitors do increase the cardiovascular risk in these women.
Action: Finish[Yes, adjuvant aromatase inhibitors increase the cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: According to the results from this meta-analysis, the risk of grade 3 and 4 CVAEs in patients who were receiving AIs was higher compared with the risk in patients who were receiving tamoxifen, and the difference reached statistical significance. However, the AD was relatively low, and from 160 to 180 patients had to be treated to produce 1 event.

Relevant Context: This investigation assesses the effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel on postoperative pain, swelling, and trismus as well as healing and bone regeneration potential on mandibular third molar extraction sockets.
A prospective randomized comparative clinical study was undertaken over a 2-year period. Patients requiring surgical extraction of a single impacted third molar and who fell within the inclusion criteria and indicated willingness to return for recall visits were recruited. The predictor variable was application of PRP gel to the socket of the third molar in the test group, whereas the control group had no PRP. The outcome variables were pain, swelling, and maximum mouth opening, which were measured using a 10-point visual analog scale, tape, and millimeter caliper, respectively. Socket healing was assessed radiographically by allocating scores for lamina dura, overall density, and trabecular pattern. Quantitative data were presented as mean. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare means between groups for continuous variables, whereas Fischer exact test was used for categorical variables. Statistical significance was inferred at P<.05.
Sixty patients aged 19 to 35 years (mean: 24.7 ± 3.6 years) were divided into both test and control groups of 30 patients each. The mean postoperative pain score (visual analog scale) was lower for the PRP group at all time points and this was statistically significant (P<.05). Although the figures for swelling and interincisal mouth opening were lower in the test group, this difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, the scores for lamina dura, trabecular pattern, and bone density were better among patients in the PRP group. This difference was also not statistically significant.
Question: Can autologous platelet-rich plasma gel enhance healing after surgical extraction of mandibular third molars?
Thought: The investigation focused on the effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel on postoperative pain, swelling, trismus, healing, and bone regeneration potential after mandibular third molar extraction. The results showed that the mean postoperative pain score was lower for the PRP group, indicating potential benefits in pain management. However, the differences in swelling, mouth opening, and radiographic healing parameters were not statistically significant. Therefore, while PRP gel may help reduce pain, its impact on overall healing after surgical extraction of mandibular third molars is inconclusive based on the study findings.
Action: Finish[Inconclusive]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The PRP group recorded reduced pain, swelling, and trismus as well as enhanced and faster bone healing compared with those in the control. Hence the study showed that topical application of PRP gel has a beneficial effect in enhancing socket healing after third molar surgery.

Relevant Context: Adults with GH deficiency (GHD) have a decreased life expectancy. The effect of GH treatment on mortality remains to be established.
This nationwide cohort study investigates the effect of GH treatment on all-cause and cause-specific mortality and analyzes patient characteristics influencing mortality in GHD adults.
Patients in the Dutch National Registry of Growth Hormone Treatment in Adults were retrospectively monitored (1985-2009) and subdivided into treatment (n = 2229), primary (untreated, n = 109), and secondary control (partly treated, n = 356) groups.
Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated for all-cause, malignancy, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Expected mortality was obtained from cause, sex, calendar year, and age-specific death rates from national death and population counts.
In the treatment group, 95 patients died compared to 74.6 expected [SMR 1.27 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.56)]. Mortality was higher in women than in men. After exclusion of high-risk patients, the SMR for CVD mortality remained increased in women. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated. In the control groups mortality was not different from the background population. Univariate analyses demonstrated sex, GHD onset, age, and underlying diagnosis as influencing factors.
Question: Does growth hormone replacement therapy reduce mortality in adults with growth hormone deficiency?
Thought: The context provided indicates that there is an increased mortality rate in adults with growth hormone deficiency, but it does not definitively state whether growth hormone replacement therapy reduces mortality. However, based on the information presented, it seems that growth hormone replacement therapy may not significantly reduce mortality in adults with growth hormone deficiency.
Action: Finish[No, growth hormone replacement therapy does not significantly reduce mortality in adults with growth hormone deficiency]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: GHD men receiving GH treatment have a mortality rate not different from the background population. In women, after exclusion of high-risk patients, mortality was not different from the background population except for CVD. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated in adults receiving GH treatment. Next to gender, the heterogeneous etiology is of influence on mortality in GHD adults with GH treatment.

Relevant Context: To investigate the influence of laparoscopic procedures on perisinusoidal cell function.
In 31 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis, the serum levels of beta-N-acetyl hexosaminidase (beta-NAH) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were measured. Six female patients, who underwent other laparoscopic procedures, not involving the hepatobiliary system, served as controls.
HA serum levels increased significantly in both study and control groups, while beta-NAH serum levels remained within normal values. Post-operative AST and ALT serum levels increased significantly only in the study group. No elevation of serum ALP was noted in any of our patients, and post-operative bilirubin levels did not increase in patients with normal pre-operative levels.
Question: Does laparoscopic cholecystectomy influence peri-sinusoidal cell activity?
Thought: The context provided describes a study on the influence of laparoscopic cholecystectomy on perisinusoidal cell function. The study measured serum levels of beta-N-acetyl hexosaminidase (beta-NAH) and hyaluronic acid (HA) in patients who underwent this procedure. The results showed that HA serum levels increased significantly in both the study and control groups, while beta-NAH serum levels remained normal. Post-operative AST and ALT serum levels increased significantly only in the study group. Based on this information, it can be concluded that laparoscopic cholecystectomy does influence peri-sinusoidal cell activity.
Action: Finish[Yes, laparoscopic cholecystectomy does influence peri-sinusoidal cell activity.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.

Relevant Context: The 'law of spatiotemporal concentrations of events' introduced major preventative shifts in policing communities. 'Hotspots' are at the forefront of these developments yet somewhat understudied in emergency medicine. Furthermore, little is known about interagency 'data-crossover', despite some developments through the Cardiff Model. Can police-ED interagency data-sharing be used to reduce community-violence using a hotspots methodology?
12-month (2012) descriptive study and analysis of spatiotemporal clusters of police and emergency calls for service using hotspots methodology and assessing the degree of incident overlap. 3775 violent crime incidents and 775 assault incidents analysed using spatiotemporal clustering with k-means++ algorithm and Spearman's rho.
Spatiotemporal location of calls for services to the police and the ambulance service are equally highly concentrated in a small number of geographical areas, primarily within intra-agency hotspots (33% and 53%, respectively) but across agencies' hotspots as well (25% and 15%, respectively). Datasets are statistically correlated with one another at the 0.57 and 0.34 levels, with 50% overlap when adjusted for the number of hotspots. At least one in every two police hotspots does not have an ambulance hotspot overlapping with it, suggesting half of assault spatiotemporal concentrations are unknown to the police. Data further suggest that more severely injured patients, as estimated by transfer to hospital, tend to be injured in the places with the highest number of police-recorded crimes.
Question: Can routinely collected ambulance data about assaults contribute to reduction in community violence?
Thought: The context provided discusses the correlation between police and ambulance service data in relation to violent crime incidents and assaults. It suggests that there is a significant overlap between the two datasets, with more severely injured patients being in areas with high police-recorded crimes. Therefore, routinely collected ambulance data about assaults can potentially contribute to the reduction in community violence by providing valuable insights into high-risk areas.
Action: Finish[Yes, routinely collected ambulance data about assaults can contribute to the reduction in community violence by providing valuable insights into high-risk areas.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: A hotspots approach to sharing data circumvents the problem of disclosing person-identifiable data between different agencies. Practically, at least half of ambulance hotspots are unknown to the police; if causal, it suggests that data sharing leads to both reduced community violence by way of prevention (such as through anticipatory patrols or problem-oriented policing), particularly of more severe assaults, and improved efficiency of resource deployment.

Relevant Context: Adhesive capsulitis is often difficult to diagnose in its early stage and to differentiate from other common shoulder disorders.
The aim of this study was to validate any or all of the 8 clinical identifiers of early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis established in an earlier Delphi study.
This was a cross-sectional study.
Sixty-four patients diagnosed with early-stage adhesive capsulitis by a physical therapist or medical practitioner were included in the study. Eight active and 8 passive shoulder movements and visual analog scale pain scores for each movement were recorded prior to and immediately following an intra-articular injection of corticosteroid and local anesthetic. Using the local anesthetic as the reference standard, pain relief of ≥70% for passive external rotation was deemed a positive anesthetic response (PAR).
Sixteen participants (25%) demonstrated a PAR. Univariate logistic regression identified that of the proposed identifiers, global loss of passive range of movement (odds ratio [OR]=0.26, P=.03), pain at the end of range of all measured active movements (OR=0.06, P=.02), and global loss of passive glenohumeral movements (OR=0.23, P=.02) were associated with a PAR. Following stepwise removal of the variables, pain at the end of range of all measured active movements remained the only identifier but was associated with reduced odds of a PAR.
The lack of a recognized reference standard for diagnosing early-stage adhesive capsulitis remains problematic in all related research.
Question: Clinical identifiers for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis: are we seeing the real picture?
Thought: The question is asking about the validity of the clinical identifiers for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis. Based on the context provided, it seems that the identified clinical identifiers may not accurately reflect the real picture of the condition, as the lack of a recognized reference standard for diagnosis remains problematic.
Action: Finish[The clinical identifiers for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis may not accurately reflect the real picture of the condition, as the lack of a recognized reference standard for diagnosis remains problematic.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.

Relevant Context: Lower limb compartment syndrome has been reported to occur after colorectal, urological, and gynecological procedures during which the patient's lower limbs are elevated for prolonged periods of time.
We investigated lower limb perfusion in a group of patients undergoing prolonged pelvic surgery both during and immediately after surgery, using intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring, laser doppler flowmetry, and pulse oximetry.
Use of the modified lithotomy position was not associated with any demonstrable decrease in lower limb perfusion. The addition of 15 degrees head-down tilt, however, during pelvic dissection, led to an immediate and significant drop in lower limb perfusion (P<0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). The subgroup of patients analyzed postoperatively showed a ten-fold increase (P<0.01) in perfusion that was confined to the muscle compartment with no demonstrable increase in skin perfusion or intra-arterial pedal blood pressure.
Question: Lloyd-Davies position with Trendelenburg--a disaster waiting to happen?
Thought: The context provided discusses lower limb perfusion during prolonged pelvic surgery and the effects of different positions on perfusion. The Lloyd-Davies position with Trendelenburg was not specifically mentioned, but based on the information given, it seems that the addition of head-down tilt during pelvic dissection led to a significant drop in lower limb perfusion. This suggests that the Lloyd-Davies position with Trendelenburg could potentially be problematic for lower limb perfusion during surgery.
Action: Finish[Potentially, yes. The addition of head-down tilt during pelvic dissection led to a significant drop in lower limb perfusion, so the Lloyd-Davies position with Trendelenburg may pose a risk for lower limb perfusion during surgery.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The use of the modified lithotomy position during pelvic surgery is not associated with lower limb ischemia. Addition of Trendelenburg position, however, causes profound ischemia of the lower limbs, and this is followed during the recovery period by hyperperfusion that is confined to the muscle compartments, which may put patients at risk of developing lower limb compartment syndrome.

Relevant Context: The principal causes of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy in Mexico, are preeclampsia/eclampsia, obstetric hemorrhage and puerperium complications; this is, 62% of maternal deaths in last years. HELLP syndrome was observed between 5 to 25% of the mortality in pregnancies of 36 weeks or less.
To analyze patients with HELLP syndrome in ICU's (Intensive Care Unit) of a Gynecology and Obstetric Hospital, related to the abnormal hematological, hepatic and renal results with the obstetric case history and the clinical complications.
A transversal study in patients with HELLP syndrome during 1998 and 1999 were carry out.
Peripheral blood with Microangiopathic hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes: AST, ALT over 40 UI/L, even when were LDH lower than 600 UI/L. It was evaluated the hepatic and renal function, platelets count, microangiopathic hemolysis, arterial pressure, seizures, icteric skin color, blindness, visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting and upper quadrant right abdominal pain. In newborn we analyzed gestational age, sex, weight and APGAR. We studied for an association between maternal and biochemical variables with Correlation Pearson Test, and dependence between variables with lineal regression model.
2878 patients with hypertensives disorders in pregnancy (11.64%). The 1.15% (n = 33) had HELLP syndrome with specific maternal mortality of 0.4 per 10,000 live birth, perinatal mortality of 1.62 per 10,000 live birth; and renal damage in 84.5%. Coefficient beta was higher between number of pregnancies to platelets count (-0.33) and creatinine clearance (-0.401).
Question: The HELPP syndrome--evidence of a possible systemic inflammatory response in pre-eclampsia?
Thought: The context provided discusses the HELLP syndrome and its association with maternal and biochemical variables. It mentions evaluating hepatic and renal function, platelet count, and other clinical complications. The study aims to analyze patients with HELLP syndrome in ICU's of a Gynecology and Obstetric Hospital. Based on this information, it is possible that there is evidence of a systemic inflammatory response in pre-eclampsia related to HELLP syndrome.
Action: Finish[Yes, there is evidence of a possible systemic inflammatory response in pre-eclampsia related to HELLP syndrome.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: We found an important renal damage, low platelets, elevated liver enzymes in women with two or more pregnancies. Then we propose there are similarities between HELLP syndrome and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) because they could have the same pathophysiology.

Relevant Context: To determine whether post-operative administration of topical ropivacaine hydrochloride decreases morbidity following adenotonsillectomy.
Prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
University referral center; ENT Department.
Fourty one children, aged 4-16 years, undergoing tonsillectomy.
Patients received 1.0% ropivacaine hydrochloride soaked swabs packed in their tonsillar fossae while the control group received saline-soaked swabs. Mc Grath's face scale was used to compare the two groups in respect of pain control. Chi-square and two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests or Mann-Whitney-U-tests were used to compare the two independent groups. As 10 we made 11 comparison between groups, for Bonferroni correction, p<0.005 was accepted as statistically significant.
Only first hour there was no significant pain-relieving effect seen in the ropivacaine group (p>0.05). The other hours and days there were statistically significance between the two groups (p<0.001). Also, the other post-operative parameters such as nausea, fever, vomiting, odor, bleeding, otalgia and trismus were not statistically different between the two groups. There were no complications associated with ropivacaine hydrochloride. No patients in this study suffered systemic side effects related to the use of this medication.
Question: Does topical ropivacaine reduce the post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients?
Thought: The study conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial to determine if post-operative administration of topical ropivacaine hydrochloride decreases morbidity following adenotonsillectomy in pediatric patients. The results showed statistically significant pain relief in the ropivacaine group compared to the control group in the hours and days following the procedure. Additionally, there were no complications or systemic side effects associated with ropivacaine use.
Action: Finish[Yes, topical ropivacaine hydrochloride reduces post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients based on the results of the study.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.

Relevant Context: Base Deficit (BD) is a marker of tissue hypoxia in polytrauma patients. It guides resuscitative measures, and predicts outcomes, complications and mortality. The aim of this study was to examine the presence of BD in patients with isolated severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and to assess if it correlates with the outcomes in these patients.
This was a retrospective observational study. All patients over the age of 16 years presenting to Aga Khan University Hospital from 2009 to 2013 with isolated TBI, were included. Data was extracted from 2009 to 2013. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of 4 and 5 at last follow up was categorized as favorable outcome. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 19 and receiver operative curve (ROC) was generated for BD as a predictor of mortality and unfavorable outcome.
One hundred and eight patients were analyzed. Ninety-eight (90.7%) were males. Mean age was 36.69 ± 17.65. Eighty-eight (81.5%) patients had BD, while 20 (18.5%) patients had base excess. 62 (58.5%) of the patients had unfavorable outcomes. BD on admission had a statistically significant negative correlation with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on presentation (r = -0.239, p = 0.025) and Revised Trauma Score (RTS) (r = -0.214, p = 0.046). However, there was no statistically significant difference in means of BD between survivors and non survivors. Area under receiver operator curve (ROC) for BD as a predictor of mortality statistically non-significant.
Question: Does base deficit predict mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury?
Thought: The question is asking about the predictive value of base deficit in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Based on the context provided, it seems that while base deficit correlates with certain outcomes and clinical parameters, it may not be a significant predictor of mortality in these patients.
Action: Finish[Base deficit may not be a significant predictor of mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Although BD is correlated with GCS at presentation and RTS, it is not a reliable prognostic marker for outcome and mortality in patients with isolated TBI.

Relevant Context: This study examines whether having a regular clinician for preventive care is associated with quality of care for young children, as measured by interpersonal quality ratings and content of anticipatory guidance.
The National Survey of Early Childhood Health (NSECH), a nationally representative parent survey of health care quality for 2068 young US children fielded by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).
Bivariate and multivariate analyses evaluate associations between having a regular clinician for well child care and interpersonal quality, the content of anticipatory guidance, and timely access to care.
In bivariate analysis, parents of children with a regular clinician for preventive care reported slightly higher interpersonal quality (69 vs. 65 on a 0-100 scale, P = 0.01). Content of anticipatory guidance received was slightly greater for children with a regular clinician (82 vs. 80 on a 0-100 scale, P = 0.03). In bivariate analysis, a regular clinician was associated with interpersonal quality only among African American and Hispanic children. In multivariate analyses, controlling for factors that could independently influence self-reports of experiences with care, interpersonal quality but not anticipatory guidance content was higher for children with a regular clinician.
Question: Does having a regular primary care clinician improve quality of preventive care for young children?
Thought: The study examines the association between having a regular clinician for preventive care and the quality of care for young children. Based on the context provided, it is evident that having a regular primary care clinician is associated with higher interpersonal quality of care for young children, but not necessarily with the content of anticipatory guidance.
Action: Finish[Yes, having a regular primary care clinician is associated with improved quality of preventive care for young children, particularly in terms of interpersonal quality.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Having a regular primary care clinician is embraced in pediatrics, although team care among physicians is also widely practiced. For young children, having a regular clinician is associated with modest gains in interpersonal quality and no differences in content of anticipatory guidance. The benefit of having a regular clinician may primarily occur in interpersonal quality for subgroups of young children.

Relevant Context: Noise exposure in the neonatal intensive care unit is believed to be a risk factor for hearing loss in preterm neonates. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices exceed recommended noise levels. High flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) are an increasingly popular alternative to CPAP for treating preterm infants, but there are no in vivo studies assessing noise production by HFNC.
To study whether HFNC are noisier than bubble CPAP (BCPAP) for preterm infants.
An observational study of preterm infants receiving HFNC or BCPAP. Noise levels within the external auditory meatus (EAM) were measured using a microphone probe tube connected to a calibrated digital dosimeter. Noise was measured across a range of frequencies and reported as decibels A-weighted (dBA).
A total of 21 HFNC and 13 BCPAP noise measurements were performed in 21 infants. HFNC gas flows were 2-5 L/min, and BCPAP gas flows were 6-10 L/min with set pressures of 5-7 cm of water. There was no evidence of a difference in average noise levels measured at the EAM: mean difference (95% CI) of -1.6 (-4.0 to 0.9) dBA for HFNC compared to BCPAP. At low frequency (500 Hz), HFNC was mean (95% CI) 3.0 (0.3 to 5.7) dBA quieter than BCPAP. Noise increased with increasing BCPAP gas flow (p=0.007), but not with increasing set pressure. There was a trend to noise increasing with increasing HFNC gas flows.
Question: Are high flow nasal cannulae noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants?
Thought: The study compared noise levels between high flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) and bubble CPAP (BCPAP) for preterm infants. The results showed that there was no significant difference in average noise levels measured at the external auditory meatus between HFNC and BCPAP. However, at low frequency (500 Hz), HFNC was quieter than BCPAP. Therefore, based on the study findings, high flow nasal cannulae are not noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants.
Action: Finish[High flow nasal cannulae are not noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: At the gas flows studied, HFNC are not noisier than BCPAP for preterm infants.

Relevant Context: Tinnitus can be related to many different aetiologies such as hearing loss or a noise trauma, but it can also be related to the somatosensory system of the cervical spine, called cervicogenic somatic tinnitus (CST). Case studies suggest a positive effect of cervical spine treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST, but no experimental studies are available.
To investigate the effect of a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST.
Randomized controlled trial.
Patients with a combination of severe subjective tinnitus (Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI): 25-90 points) and neck complaints (Neck Bournemouth Questionnaire (NBQ) > 14 points).
All patients received cervical physical therapy for 6 weeks (12 sessions). Patients were randomized in an immediate-start therapy group (n = 19) and a 6-week delayed-start therapy group (n = 19).
TFI and NBQ-scores were documented at baseline, after the wait-and-see period in the delayed-start group, after treatment and after 6 weeks follow-up. The Global Perceived Effect (GPE) was documented at all measuring moments, except at baseline.
In all patients (n = 38) TFI and NBQ-scores decreased significantly after treatment (p = 0.04 and p < 0.001). NBQ-scores remained significantly lower after follow-up (p = 0.001). Immediately after treatment, 53% (n = 38) experienced substantial improvement of tinnitus. This effect was maintained in 24% of patients after follow-up at six weeks.
Question: Does multi-modal cervical physical therapy improve tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus?
Thought: The study aimed to investigate the effect of a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus. The results showed that TFI and NBQ scores decreased significantly after treatment, with a substantial improvement in tinnitus experienced by 53% of patients immediately after treatment. This effect was maintained in 24% of patients after a follow-up at six weeks. Therefore, based on the findings of the study, multi-modal cervical physical therapy does improve tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus.
Action: Finish[Yes, multi-modal cervical physical therapy improves tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.

Relevant Context: Bystander resuscitation plays an important role in lifesaving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A significant reduction in the "no-flow-time", quantitatively better chest compressions and an improved quality of ventilation can be demonstrated during CPR using supraglottic airway devices (SADs). Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of inexperienced persons to operate SADs after brief instruction. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether an instruction manual consisting of four diagrams enables laypersons to operate a Laryngeal Mask Supreme® (LMAS) in the manikin.
An instruction manual of four illustrations with speech bubbles displaying the correct use of the LMAS was designed. Laypersons were handed a bag containing a LMAS, a bag mask valve device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated.
A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96.7%) inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted inverted or twisted in 13 (8.7%) attempts. Eight (5.3%) individuals recognized this and corrected the position. Within the first 2 minutes 119 (79.3%) applicants were able to insert the LMAS and provide tidal volumes greater than 150 ml (estimated dead space). Time to insertion and first ventilation was 83.2 ± 29 s. No significant difference related to previous BLS training (P = 0.85), technical education (P = 0.07) or gender could be demonstrated (P = 0.25).
Question: Does a 4 diagram manual enable laypersons to operate the Laryngeal Mask Supreme®?
Thought: The question is asking whether a 4 diagram manual helps laypersons operate the Laryngeal Mask Supreme®. Based on the context provided, it is clear that the manual did enable laypersons to operate the Laryngeal Mask Supreme® successfully.
Action: Finish[Yes, the 4 diagram manual enabled laypersons to operate the Laryngeal Mask Supreme® successfully]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: In manikin laypersons could insert LMAS in the correct direction after onsite instruction by a simple manual with a high success rate. This indicates some basic procedural understanding and intellectual transfer in principle. Operating errors (n = 91) were frequently not recognized and corrected (n = 77). Improvements in labeling and the quality of instructional photographs may reduce individual error and may optimize understanding.

Relevant Context: SYNTAX score (SxS) has been demonstrated to predict long-term outcomes in stable patients with coronary artery disease. But its prognostic value for patients with acute coronary syndrome remains unknown.AIM: To evaluate whether SxS could predict in-hospital outcomes for patients admitted with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI).
The study included 538 patients with STEMI who underwent pPCI between January 2010 and December 2012. The patients were divided into two groups: low SxS (<22) and high SxS (>22). The SxS of all patients was calculated from aninitial angiogram and TIMI flow grade of infarct related artery was calculated after pPCI. Left ventricular systolic functions of the patients were evaluated with an echocardiogram in the following week. The rates of reinfarction and mortality during hospitalisation were obtained from the medical records of our hospital.
The high SxS group had more no-reflow (41% and 25.1%, p<0.001, respectively), lower ejection fraction (38.2 ± 7.5% and 44.6 ± 8.8%, p<0.001, respectively), and greater rates of re-infarction (9.5% and 7.3%, p = 0.037, respectively) and mortality (0.9% and 0.2%, p = 0.021, respectively) during hospitalisation compared to the low SxS group. On multivariate logistic regression analysis including clinical variables, SxS was an independent predictor of no-reflow (OR 1.081, 95% CI 1.032-1.133, p = 0.001).
Question: Does SYNTAX score predict in-hospital outcomes in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention?
Thought: The context provided indicates that the SYNTAX score (SxS) was evaluated in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) to determine its predictive value for in-hospital outcomes. The study found that a high SxS was associated with more adverse outcomes such as no-reflow, lower ejection fraction, reinfarction, and mortality during hospitalization. Additionally, SxS was identified as an independent predictor of no-reflow on multivariate logistic regression analysis.
Action: Finish[Yes, the SYNTAX score (SxS) predicts in-hospital outcomes in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI).]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: SxS is a useful tool that can predict in-hospital outcomes of patients with STEMI undergoing pPCI.

Relevant Context: Rapid prescreening (RPS) is one of the quality assurance (QA) methods used in gynecologic cytology. The efficacy of RPS has been previously studied but mostly with respect to squamous lesions; in fact, there has been no study so far specifically looking at the sensitivity of RPS for detecting glandular cell abnormalities.
A total of 80,565 Papanicolaou (Pap) smears underwent RPS during a 25-month period. A sample was designated as "review for abnormality" (R) if any abnormal cells (at the threshold of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance/atypical glandular cells [AGC]) were thought to be present or was designated as negative (N) if none were detected. Each sample then underwent full screening (FS) and was designated as either R or N and also given a cytologic interpretation.
The final cytologic interpretation was a glandular cell abnormality (≥AGC) in 107 samples (0.13%); 39 of these (36.4%) were flagged as R on RPS. Twenty-four patients (33.8%) out of 71 who had histologic follow-up were found to harbor a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or carcinoma; 13 of those 24 Pap smears (54.2%) had been flagged as R on RPS. Notably, 11 AGC cases were picked up by RPS only and not by FS and represented false-negative cases; 2 of these showed endometrial adenocarcinoma on histologic follow-up.
Question: Pap smears with glandular cell abnormalities: Are they detected by rapid prescreening?
Thought: The context provided discusses the use of rapid prescreening (RPS) in detecting glandular cell abnormalities in Pap smears. From the information given, it is clear that RPS is effective in detecting glandular cell abnormalities, as it flagged a significant number of samples that were later confirmed to have abnormalities.
Action: Finish[Yes, Pap smears with glandular cell abnormalities are detected by rapid prescreening]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Pap smears with glandular cell abnormalities are often flagged as abnormal by RPS, and this results in a sensitivity of 36.4% (at the AGC threshold). Most importantly, some cases of AGC are detected on Pap smears by RPS only, and this demonstrates that RPS is a valuable QA method.

Relevant Context: It is generally assumed, that patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) are at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. Therefore we performed this case control study to estimate the real risk for bleeding complications of these patients.
Between 05/95 and 07/98, ten patients with WD (eight males, two females) underwent cardiac surgery employing extracorporeal circulation (WD-group). Five of these patients with platelet counts below 80/nl were treated by immunoglobulins preoperatively. Each patient with WD was matched to five patients without WD (no-WD-group) using diagnosis, age, gender, ejection fraction, number of distal anastomosis and body-mass-index as matching criteria.
Mean number of platelet counts were significant lower in the WD-group than in the no-WD-group despite a significant increase of platelet counts after immunoglobulin treatment (54/nl-->112/nl, P=0.018). On the day before, directly after and on the first day after surgery they were 141/nl vs. 215/nl (P=0.012), 75/nl vs. 147/nl (P=0.001) and 93/nl vs. 136/nl (P=0.009). Accordingly, patients of the WD-group received significantly more platelet concentrates than patients of the no-WD-group (mean number of platelet concentrates: 2.3 versus 0.7, P=0.007). Total drainage loss via the mediastinal chest tubes was almost identical (1197 ml in the no-WD-group and 1140 ml in the WD-group). One patient of each group suffered from a bleeding complication requiring reexploration. Three patients of the no-WD-group (6%) and one patient of the WD-group (10%) expired postoperatively unrelated to WD.
Question: Are patients with Werlhof's disease at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery?
Thought: The context provided indicates that patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) are indeed at an increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. This is supported by the lower platelet counts in the WD-group compared to the no-WD-group, as well as the need for more platelet concentrates and the occurrence of bleeding complications in these patients.
Action: Finish[Yes, patients with Werlhof's disease are at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Patients with WD may possibly undergo cardiac surgery without a markedly enhanced risk for bleeding complications despite a more than usual transfusion requirement and significantly lower platelet counts perioperatively.

Relevant Context: Sublingual varices have earlier been related to ageing, smoking and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sublingual varices are related to presence of hypertension.
In an observational clinical study among 431 dental patients tongue status and blood pressure were documented. Digital photographs of the lateral borders of the tongue for grading of sublingual varices were taken, and blood pressure was measured. Those patients without previous diagnosis of hypertension and with a noted blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or ≥ 90 mmHg at the dental clinic performed complementary home blood pressure during one week. Those with an average home blood pressure ≥ 135 mmHg and/or ≥ 85 mmHg were referred to the primary health care centre, where three office blood pressure measurements were taken with one week intervals. Two independent blinded observers studied the photographs of the tongues. Each photograph was graded as none/few (grade 0) or medium/severe (grade 1) presence of sublingual varices. Pearson's Chi-square test, Student's t-test, and multiple regression analysis were applied. Power calculation stipulated a study population of 323 patients.
An association between sublingual varices and hypertension was found (OR = 2.25, p<0.002). Mean systolic blood pressure was 123 and 132 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual varices, respectively (p<0.0001, CI 95 %). Mean diastolic blood pressure was 80 and 83 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual varices, respectively (p<0.005, CI 95 %). Sublingual varices indicate hypertension with a positive predictive value of 0.5 and a negative predictive value of 0.80.
Question: Is there a connection between sublingual varices and hypertension?
Thought: The context provided indicates that there is indeed a connection between sublingual varices and hypertension, as shown by the results of the study conducted on dental patients.
Action: Finish[Yes, there is a connection between sublingual varices and hypertension, as indicated by the study results showing an odds ratio of 2.25 and significant differences in blood pressure measurements between patients with and without sublingual varices.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: An association was found between sublingual varices and hypertension. Examining the lateral borders of the tongue is easily done, causes no harm and could be a valuable method for the dental profession to take active part in preventive healthcare.

Relevant Context: Broad-based electronic health information exchange (HIE), in which patients' clinical data follow them between care delivery settings, is expected to produce large quality gains and cost savings. Although these benefits are assumed to result from reducing redundant care, there is limited supporting empirical evidence.
To evaluate whether HIE adoption is associated with decreases in repeat imaging in emergency departments (EDs).DATA SOURCE/
ED discharge data from the State Emergency Department Databases for California and Florida for 2007-2010 were merged with Health Information Management Systems Society data that report hospital HIE participation.
Using regression with ED fixed effects and trends, we performed a retrospective analysis of the impact of HIE participation on repeat imaging, comparing 37 EDs that initiated HIE participation during the study period to 410 EDs that did not participate in HIE during the same period. Within 3 common types of imaging tests [computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and chest x-ray), we defined a repeat image for a given patient as the same study in the same body region performed within 30 days at unaffiliated EDs.
In our sample there were 20,139 repeat CTs (representing 14.7% of those cases with CT in the index visit), 13,060 repeat ultrasounds (20.7% of ultrasound cases), and 29,703 repeat chest x-rays (19.5% of x-ray cases). HIE was associated with reduced probability of repeat ED imaging in all 3 modalities: -8.7 percentage points for CT [95% confidence interval (CI): -14.7, -2.7], -9.1 percentage points for ultrasound (95% CI: -17.2, -1.1), and -13.0 percentage points for chest x-ray (95% CI: -18.3, -7.7), reflecting reductions of 44%-67% relative to sample means.
Question: Does health information exchange reduce redundant imaging?
Thought: The question is asking whether health information exchange reduces redundant imaging based on the context provided. The study mentioned in the context shows that HIE participation was associated with reduced probability of repeat ED imaging in all three modalities (CT, ultrasound, and chest x-ray), with significant percentage point reductions.
Action: Finish[Yes, health information exchange reduces redundant imaging]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: HIE was associated with reduced repeat imaging in EDs. This study is among the first to find empirical support for this anticipated benefit of HIE.

Relevant Context: Specialty pharmaceuticals have evolved beyond their status as niche drugs designed to treat rare conditions and are now poised to become the standard of care in a wide variety of common chronic illnesses. Due in part to the cost of these therapies, payers are increasingly demanding evidence of their value. Determining the value of these medications is hampered by a lack of robust pharmacoeconomic data.
To outline emerging strategies and case study examples for the medical and pharmacy benefits management of specialty pharmaceuticals.
The promise of specialty pharmaceuticals: increased life expectancy, improved quality of life, enhanced workplace productivity, decreased burden of disease, and reduced health care spending comes at a significant cost. These agents require special handling, administration, patient education, clinical support, and risk mitigation. Additionally, specialty drugs require distribution systems that ensure appropriate patient selection and data collection. With the specialty pharmaceutical pipeline overflowing with new medicines and an aging population increasingly relying on these novel treatments to treat common diseases, the challenge of managing the costs associated with these agents can be daunting. Aided by sophisticated pharmacoeconomic models to assess value, the cost impacts of these specialty drugs can be appropriately controlled.
Question: The promise of specialty pharmaceuticals: are they worth the price?
Thought: The question is asking about the value of specialty pharmaceuticals in relation to their cost. Based on the context provided, specialty pharmaceuticals offer increased life expectancy, improved quality of life, enhanced workplace productivity, decreased burden of disease, and reduced health care spending. However, they come at a significant cost and require special handling, administration, and support. The value of these medications can be determined through pharmacoeconomic data analysis.
Action: Finish[Specialty pharmaceuticals offer increased life expectancy, improved quality of life, enhanced workplace productivity, decreased burden of disease, and reduced health care spending, but come at a significant cost. The value of these medications can be determined through pharmacoeconomic data analysis.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Current evidence suggests that when used in targeted patient populations, specialty pharmaceuticals may represent a good health care value.

Relevant Context: The aim of the present study was to explore patients' views on the acceptability and feasibility of using colour to describe osteoarthritis (OA) pain, and whether colour could be used to communicate pain to healthcare professionals.
Six group interviews were conducted with 17 patients with knee OA. Discussion topics included first impressions about using colour to describe pain, whether participants could associate their pain with colour, how colours related to changes to intensity and different pain qualities, and whether they could envisage using colour to describe pain to healthcare professionals.
The group interviews indicated that, although the idea of using colour was generally acceptable, it did not suit all participants as a way of describing their pain. The majority of participants chose red to describe high-intensity pain; the reasons given were because red symbolized inflammation, fire, anger and the stop signal in a traffic light system. Colours used to describe the absence of pain were chosen because of their association with positive emotional feelings, such as purity, calmness and happiness. A range of colours was chosen to represent changes in pain intensity. Aching pain was consistently identified as being associated with colours such as grey or black, whereas sharp pain was described using a wider selection of colours. The majority of participants thought that they would be able to use colour to describe their pain to healthcare professionals, although issues around the interpretability and standardization of colour were raised.
Question: The colour of pain: can patients use colour to describe osteoarthritis pain?
Thought: The question is asking if patients can use color to describe osteoarthritis pain based on the context provided. The study conducted group interviews with patients with knee OA to explore this topic.
Action: Finish[Yes, patients can use color to describe osteoarthritis pain based on the group interviews conducted in the study.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: For some patients, using colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve doctor-patient communication.

Relevant Context: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of ureteroscopy for lower ureteric stones without the use of fluoroscopy.
Between June 2001 and January 2005, a total of 110 patients with a mean age of 33.5 years (range 12-65) suffering from of lower ureteral calculi (below the upper margin of the sacroiliac joint) prospectively underwent ureteroscopic removal. Retrograde pyelography was avoided, and no safety guidewire was placed. Whenever required, the ureteric meatus was dilated with a ureteric balloon under direct vision. Double-J stent placement was done with the aid of ureteroscopy. A fluoroscope was kept standby. The patients had a postoperative X-ray of the kidney-ureter-bladder region to document the stone clearance.
The mean stone size was 8.7 mm (range 6-15). Complete clearance without the use of fluoroscopy was achieved in 99 patients (94.2%). Fluoroscopy was required in 6 patients (4%) for calcified stricture (n = 1), duplex system (n = 1), narrow and tortuous meatus causing difficulty in passing the 5-Fr balloon dilator (n = 3), and confirmation of spontaneous passage of the stone (n = 1). Of the 13 patients who required balloon dilatation it was successfully achieved without fluoroscopy. Double-J stenting was done due to mucosal ulceration (n = 3), polypoid reaction (n = 2), and perforation (n = 1). All these patients had correct placement of the stent, as confirmed by X-ray of the kidney-ureter-bladder region postoperatively.
Question: Is fluoroscopy essential for retrieval of lower ureteric stones?
Thought: The context provided indicates that in this study, ureteroscopy for lower ureteric stones was successfully performed without the use of fluoroscopy in the majority of cases. Only a small percentage of patients required fluoroscopy for specific reasons. Therefore, based on this information, fluoroscopy does not seem to be essential for the retrieval of lower ureteric stones.
Action: Finish[Fluoroscopy is not essential for retrieval of lower ureteric stones]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.

Relevant Context: Neutrophil infiltration of the lung is characteristic of early posttraumatic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study examines the ability of neutrophils isolated (over the first 24 hrs) from the peripheral blood of patients admitted after major trauma to migrate in response to interleukin-8. Interleukin-8 is elevated in the lung within 2 hrs of major trauma in patients who later develop ARDS, and thus it plays a central role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and their subsequent activation. We hypothesized that enhanced interleukin-8-mediated neutrophil migratory activity in the early postinjury phase, before the development of ARDS, may be a crucial factor in the etiology of ARDS.
Prospective observational study.
University Hospital Wales, the Royal Gwent Hospital, and East Glamorgan General Hospital. Laboratory work was conducted at the Institute of Nephrology.
Adult blunt trauma victims with Injury Severity Score>or = 18.
Neutrophils were isolated from citrated blood from 17 adult blunt major trauma patients at admission (0 hrs) and 8 and 24 hrs later. Identical samples were obtained from normal laboratory volunteers (n = 9). The neutrophil count in each specimen was measured, and the number of neutrophils migrating across porous tissue culture inserts in response to defined concentrations of interleukin-8 (0, 10, 30, and 100 ng/mL) was quantitated by peroxidase assay. Neutrophil counts in the whole blood specimens obtained from those later developing ARDS were elevated significantly at admission and declined rapidly throughout the next 24 hrs. Significantly greater numbers of trauma patients' neutrophils migrated to concentrations of interleukin-8 (30 and 100 ng/mL) at each time point when compared with normal volunteers (Mann-Whitney U test, p<.05). Neutrophils isolated from major trauma patients exhibited an enhanced migratory response to high concentrations of interleukin-8 throughout the first 24 hrs of admission, in contrast to the normal physiologic attenuation of migration seen in neutrophils isolated from normal laboratory volunteers.
Question: Increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma: a factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome?
Thought: The context provided discusses the relationship between neutrophil migratory activity and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after major trauma. The study hypothesizes that enhanced interleukin-8-mediated neutrophil migratory activity in the early postinjury phase may be a crucial factor in the etiology of ARDS.
Action: Finish[Yes, increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma, particularly in response to interleukin-8, is suggested to be a factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.

Relevant Context: To investigate the relevance of the Symptom Checklist 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale to cognition in individuals with brain tumor.
A prospective study of patients assessed with a neuropsychological test battery.
A university medical center.
Nineteen adults with biopsy-confirmed diagnoses of malignant brain tumors were assessed prior to aggressive chemotherapy.
Included in the assessment were the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, California Verbal Learning Test, Trail Making Test B, Symptom Checklist 90-R, Mood Assessment Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Chronic Illness Problem Inventory.
The SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale was not related to objective measures of attention, verbal memory, or age. It was related significantly to symptoms of depression (r = .81, P<.005), anxiety (r = .66, P<.005), and subjective complaints of memory problems (r = .75, P<.005). Multivariate analyses indicated that reported symptoms of depression contributed 66% of the variance in predicting SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive Scores, whereas symptoms of anxiety contributed an additional 6% (P<.0001).
Question: Does the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension identify cognitive impairments?
Thought: The context provided indicates that the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension is not related to objective measures of attention or verbal memory but is significantly related to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and subjective complaints of memory problems. Therefore, based on this information, it does not seem to identify cognitive impairments directly.
Action: Finish[No, the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension does not directly identify cognitive impairments.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic effects of structural brain injury.

Relevant Context: Disorders of consciousness (DOC) diagnosis relies on the presence or absence of purposeful motor responsiveness, which characterizes the minimally conscious state (MCS) and the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), respectively. Functional neuroimaging studies have raised the question of possible residual conscious awareness also in clinically-defined UWS patients. The aim of our study was to identify electrophysiological parameters, by means of a transcranial magnetic stimulation approach, which might potentially express the presence of residual networks sustaining fragmentary behavioral patterns, even when no conscious behavior can be observed.
We enrolled 25 severe DOC patients, following post-anoxic or traumatic brain injury and 20 healthy individuals (HC) as control group. Baseline electrophysiological evaluation evidenced, in comparison to HC, a partial preservation of cortical effective connectivity and excitability in clinically defined MCS, whereas these components were absent in clinically defined UWS. Then, we applied an anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) protocol over the orbitofrontal cortex.
a-tDCS was able to boost cortical connectivity and excitability in all HC, MCS, and to unmask such excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients.
Question: Can transcranial direct current stimulation be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome from minimally conscious state patients?
Thought: The context provided indicates that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was able to boost cortical connectivity and excitability in minimally conscious state (MCS) patients and unmask such excitability/connectivity in some unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients. Therefore, tDCS can be useful in differentiating between these two states.
Action: Finish[Yes, transcranial direct current stimulation can be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome from minimally conscious state patients.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a motor-output failure.

Relevant Context: To determine whether prostate morphology or technique used has any effect on postoperative outcomes after holmium laser enucleation of the prostate.
A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was completed for all patients undergoing a holmium laser enucleation of the prostate at our institution. Prostate morphology was classified as either "bilobar" or "trilobar" according to the cystoscopic appearance. The baseline characteristics, complications, and postoperative outcomes were collected.
A total of 304 patients with either "bilobar" (n = 142) or "trilobar" (n = 162) prostate morphology were included. The trilobar group was more likely to have longer operative times (112 vs 100 minutes, P = .04), although this difference was not significant on multivariate analysis. The postoperative outcomes were similar between the 2 groups for American Urological Association symptom score, change in American Urological Association symptom score, bother score, maximal flow rate, change in maximal flow rate, postvoid residual urine volume, and complication rate. However, the trilobar group had a significantly greater decrease in their PVR urine volume (296 vs 176 mL, P = .01), a difference that persisted on multivariate analysis. A subset analysis of the trilobar prostates revealed that performing a 2-lobe technique achieved shorter operative and enucleation times, although the difference was not significant.
Question: Does prostate morphology affect outcomes after holmium laser enucleation?
Thought: The context provided indicates that a study was conducted to determine if prostate morphology has any effect on postoperative outcomes after holmium laser enucleation. The study found that while there were some differences in operative times and postoperative outcomes between "bilobar" and "trilobar" prostate morphologies, the overall impact was not significant for most outcomes. However, the trilobar group did show a significantly greater decrease in postvoid residual urine volume compared to the bilobar group.
Action: Finish[Prostate morphology does not significantly affect outcomes after holmium laser enucleation, except for a greater decrease in postvoid residual urine volume in the trilobar group.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Those patients with trilobar prostate morphology are more likely to achieve a greater decrease in the PVR urine volume after holmium laser enucleation of the prostate. All other outcomes appeared to be similar between the 2 groups. In addition, a 2-lobe technique can be safely used for trilobar prostates when deemed feasible by the surgeon.

Relevant Context: Deaths from injury and poisoning (suicide, accidents, undetermined deaths, and homicide) are the major cause of death among young men aged 15-39 years in England and Wales and have been increasing in recent years.AIM: To describe common characteristics among young men who die from injury and poisoning.
We employed a retrospective survey methodology to investigate factors associated with deaths by injury and poisoning among young men aged 15-39 years (n = 268) in Merseyside and Cheshire during 1995. Data were collected from Coroner's inquest notes and General Practitioner records.
The most common cause of death was poisoning by alcohol and drugs (29.1%, n = 78). A high proportion of cases were unemployed (39.4%, n = 106). Cases were also more likely to be single compared to the general population (74.2% vs 55.5%). Self-destructive behaviour was evident in 77% of deaths (n = 206).
Question: Injury and poisoning mortality among young men--are there any common factors amenable to prevention?
Thought: The context provided highlights that the most common cause of death among young men aged 15-39 years is poisoning by alcohol and drugs, with a high proportion of cases being unemployed and single. Self-destructive behavior was also evident in a significant number of deaths. These factors suggest that mental health support, substance abuse prevention programs, and employment opportunities could be key factors amenable to prevention.
Action: Finish[Mental health support, substance abuse prevention programs, and employment opportunities]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Alcohol and drug use are important contributory factors to injury and poisoning deaths. More research is needed into the effects of unemployment and being single on the health of young men, and to investigate the motivations behind risk taking and self-destructive behaviour.

Relevant Context: Home blood pressure (BP) monitoring is gaining increasing popularity among patients and may be useful in hypertension management. Little is known about the reliability of stroke patients' records of home BP monitoring.
To assess the reliability of home BP recording in hypertensive patients who had suffered a recent stroke or transient ischaemic attack.
Thirty-nine stroke patients (mean age 73 years) randomized to the intervention arm of a trial of home BP monitoring were included. Following instruction by a research nurse, patients recorded their BPs at home and documented them in a booklet over the next year. The booklet readings over a month were compared with the actual readings downloaded from the BP monitor and were checked for errors or selective bias in recording.
A total of 1027 monitor and 716 booklet readings were recorded. Ninety per cent of booklet recordings were exactly the same as the BP monitor readings. Average booklet readings were 0.6 mmHg systolic [95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.6 to 1.8] and 0.3 mmHg diastolic (95% CI -0.3 to 0.8) lower than those on the monitor.
Question: Are stroke patients' reports of home blood pressure readings reliable?
Thought: The context provided indicates that 90% of the booklet recordings were exactly the same as the BP monitor readings, with only a small difference in average readings. This suggests that stroke patients' reports of home blood pressure readings are reliable.
Action: Finish[Yes, stroke patients' reports of home blood pressure readings are reliable]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: This group of elderly stroke patients were able to record their BPs reliably at home. Any bias was small and would be unlikely to affect management. Since BP readings in a GP surgery are often a poor indication of true BP, GPs might consider using hypertensive patients' records of home BP monitoring to help guide treatment decisions.

Relevant Context: We have reported previously that cerulein-induced edematous pancreatitis would transform into hemorrhagic pancreatitis by administration of endothelin-1 in rats. In the present study, we tried to protect rat model from developing into hemorrhagic pancreatitis with BQ123 (an ETA receptor antagonist).
The rat model was made by 5-hour restraint water-immersion stress and two intraperitoneal injections of cerulein (40 micrograms/kg) at hourly interval. BQ123 (3 or 6 mg/kg) was administered intravenously 30 minutes before and 2 hours after the first cerulein injection.
Acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis was induced in all rats treated with cerulin + stress. The score for pancreatic hemorrhage was 2.4 +/- 0.2 in this group. In the rats pretreated with BQ123, the score was reduced to 1.0 +/- 0.0, pancreas wet weight and serum amylase activity were significantly reduced, and histologic alterations in the pancreas lightened, also the local pancreatic blood flow improved without affecting the systemic blood pressure.
Question: Is endothelin-1 an aggravating factor in the development of acute pancreatitis?
Thought: The context provided indicates that administration of endothelin-1 in rats transformed edematous pancreatitis into hemorrhagic pancreatitis. However, when an ETA receptor antagonist (BQ123) was administered, the development of hemorrhagic pancreatitis was prevented. Therefore, endothelin-1 can be considered an aggravating factor in the development of acute pancreatitis.
Action: Finish[Yes, endothelin-1 is an aggravating factor in the development of acute pancreatitis.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: These results suggest that endothelin-1 should play a role in aggravating the development of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis, through its action on the pancreatic microcirculation.

Relevant Context: Hyperleptinemia and oxidative stress play a major role in the development of cardiovascular diseases in obesity. This study aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between plasma levels of leptin and phagocytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity, and its potential relevance in the vascular remodeling in obese patients.
The study was performed in 164 obese and 94 normal-weight individuals (controls). NADPH oxidase activity was evaluated by luminescence in phagocytic cells. Levels of leptin were quantified by ELISA in plasma samples. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) was measured by ultrasonography. In addition, we performed in-vitro experiments in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine macrophages.
Phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity and leptin levels were enhanced (P<0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. NADPH oxidase activity positively correlated with leptin in obese patients. This association remained significant in a multivariate analysis. cIMT was higher (P<0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. In addition, cIMT also correlated positively with leptin and NADPH oxidase activity in obese patients. In-vitro studies showed that leptin induced NADPH oxidase activation. Inhibition of the leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activity by wortmannin and bisindolyl maleimide suggested a direct involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C pathways, respectively. Finally, leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activation promoted macrophage proliferation.
Question: Is leptin involved in phagocytic NADPH oxidase overactivity in obesity?
Thought: The context provided indicates that there is a relationship between plasma levels of leptin and phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity in obese patients. The study found that NADPH oxidase activity positively correlated with leptin in obese patients, and in-vitro experiments showed that leptin induced NADPH oxidase activation. Therefore, leptin is indeed involved in phagocytic NADPH oxidase overactivity in obesity.
Action: Finish[Yes, leptin is involved in phagocytic NADPH oxidase overactivity in obesity.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: These findings show that phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity is increased in obesity and is related to preclinical atherosclerosis in this condition. We also suggest that hyperleptinemia may contribute to phagocytic NADPH oxidase overactivity in obesity.

Relevant Context: The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcomes that are associated with pregnancy and treated hypothyroidism.
This was a retrospective cohort study of all women who received prenatal care and were delivered at the University of California, San Francisco, between 1989 and 2001. All patients with hypothyroidism diagnosed before pregnancy or early in pregnancy were identified. Maternal, fetal, and obstetric outcomes were then collected and analyzed for women with hypothyroidism and compared with women without hypothyroidism.
Among 20,499 deliveries, there were 419 women (2.1%) who were treated for hypothyroidism during the study period. Hypothyroidism was more common among women>or =35 years old, white women, and women without Medicaid insurance. Treated hypothyroidism was not associated with any increase in maternal, fetal, or neonatal complications. In addition, hypothyroidism did not affect mode of delivery.
Question: Are women who are treated for hypothyroidism at risk for pregnancy complications?
Thought: The question is asking about the risk of pregnancy complications for women treated for hypothyroidism. Based on the context provided, it is clear that treated hypothyroidism was not associated with any increase in maternal, fetal, or neonatal complications, nor did it affect the mode of delivery.
Action: Finish[Women who are treated for hypothyroidism are not at risk for pregnancy complications.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Compared with patients without hypothyroidism, patients with treated hypothyroidism are not at any increased risk for perinatal morbidity.

Relevant Context: Epidemiological studies have suggested inverse relationships between blood pressure and prevalence of conditions such as migraine and headache. It is not yet clear whether similar relationships can be established for back pain in particular in prospective studies.
Associations between blood pressure and chronic low back pain were explored in the cross-sectional HUNT 2 survey of a Norwegian county in 1995-1997, including 39,872 individuals who never used antihypertensive medication. A prospective study, comprising 17,209 initially back pain-free individuals and 5740 individuals reporting low back pain, was established by re-examinations in the HUNT 3 survey in 2006-2008. Associations were assessed by logistic regression with respect to systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure, with adjustment for education, work status, physical activity, smoking, body mass and lipid levels.
In the cross-sectional study, all three blood pressure measures showed inverse relationships with prevalence of low back pain in both sexes. In the prospective study of disease-free women, baseline pulse pressure and systolic pressure were inversely associated with risk of low back pain [odds ratio (OR) 0.93 per 10 mm Hg increase in pulse pressure, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89-0.98, p = 0.007; OR 0.95 per 10 mm Hg increase in systolic pressure, 95% CI 0.92-0.99, p = 0.005]. Results among men were equivocal. No associations were indicated with the occurrence of pain in individuals with low back pain at baseline.
Question: Does high blood pressure reduce the risk of chronic low back pain?
Thought: The context provided discusses the relationship between blood pressure and chronic low back pain. Based on the information given, it seems that high blood pressure, specifically pulse pressure and systolic pressure, may actually reduce the risk of chronic low back pain in women, but the results are unclear for men.
Action: Finish[High blood pressure may reduce the risk of chronic low back pain in women, but results are equivocal for men.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Results for low back pain are consistent with the theory of hypertension-associated hypalgesia, predicting diminished pain sensitivity with increasing blood pressure, possibly with modified reactions in people suffering from long-lasting pain.

Relevant Context: Acute pancreatitis is the major complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure and there are some reports showing cytokine changes in ERCP-induced pancreatits.GOALS: To investigate the association between early changes (within 24 hours) in the serum interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, and IL-6 levels and the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis.STUDY: Forty five consecutive patients who underwent therapeutic ERCP and 10 patients with acute pancreatitis without ERCP were enrolled to the study. Serum concentrations of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 were determined immediately before, 12 hours and 24 hours after ERCP.
Seven of the 45 patients (15.5%) developed post-ERCP pancreatitis. The levels of IL-4 at 24 hours after ERCP were significantly lower in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis than in those without pancreatitis, while TNFalpha levels at 12 hours after ERCP were higher in the complicated group than those of the uncomplicated group. The ratios of TNFalpha/IL-4 at 12 and 24 hours after ERCP were found significantly higher in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis than in those without pancreatitis. IL-6 in the complicated patients was found significantly increased at 24 hours after ERCP.
Question: Do the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 reflect the inflammatory activity in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis?
Thought: The question is asking if the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 reflect the inflammatory activity in patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis. Based on the context provided, it is clear that the levels of these cytokines are associated with the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis, with specific changes in IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 levels being linked to the condition.
Action: Finish[Yes, the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 do reflect the inflammatory activity in patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The enhancement of serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.

Relevant Context: Most pediatric surgeons perform oophorectomy in girls presenting with ovarian torsion in which the ovary appears necrotic. However, the adult gynecology literature suggests that many ovaries can be treated by detorsion alone.
All children with ovarian torsion on the gynecology and general surgery services between 1988 and 2002 were reviewed.
There were 36 torsions in 34 children. Seventeen underwent detorsion with or without ovarian cystectomy, and 19 had oophorectomy (mean age 10 years in both groups). Torsion was suspected preoperatively in 94% of the detorsion cases and in 47% of the oophorectomy patients. Median time from presentation to surgery was significantly lower in the detorsion than the oophorectomy group (median 14 v 27 hours; P =.04). Postoperative complications and length of stay were similar between the 2 groups. Despite the ovary being judged intraoperatively as moderately to severely ischemic in 53% of the detorsion cases, follow-up sonogram or ovarian biopsy available in 14 of the 17 cases showed normal ovary with follicular development in each case.
Question: Ovarian torsion in children: is oophorectomy necessary?
Thought: The context provided discusses a study on ovarian torsion in children and the outcomes of detorsion versus oophorectomy. Based on the findings that detorsion alone was successful in many cases, it suggests that oophorectomy may not be necessary in all cases of ovarian torsion in children.
Action: Finish[Oophorectomy may not be necessary in all cases of ovarian torsion in children, as detorsion alone was successful in many cases according to the study findings.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.

Relevant Context: To assess the results of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in patients with Cushing's disease over a period of 18 years, and to determine if there are factors which will predict the outcome.
Sixty-nine sequential patients treated surgically by a single surgeon in Newcastle upon Tyne between 1980 and 1997 were identified and data from 61 of these have been analysed.
Retrospective analysis of outcome measures.
Patients were divided into three groups (remission, failure and relapse) depending on the late outcome of their treatment as determined at the time of analysis, i.e. 88 months (median) years after surgery. Remission is defined as biochemical reversal of hypercortisolism with re-emergence of diurnal circadian rhythm, resolution of clinical features and adequate suppression on low-dose dexamethasone testing. Failure is defined as the absence of any of these features. Relapse is defined as the re-emergence of Cushing's disease more than one year after operation. Clinical features such as weight, sex, hypertension, associated endocrine disorders and smoking, biochemical studies including preoperative and postoperative serum cortisol, urine free cortisol, serum ACTH, radiological, histological and surgical findings were assessed in relation to these three groups to determine whether any factors could reliably predict failure or relapse after treatment.
Of the 61 patients included in this study, 48 (78.7%) achieved initial remission and 13 (21.3%) failed treatment. Seven patients suffered subsequent relapse (range 22-158 months) in their condition after apparent remission, leaving a final group of 41 patients (67.2%) in the remission group. Tumour was identified at surgery in 52 patients, of whom 38 achieved remission. In comparison, only 3 of 9 patients in whom no tumour was identified achieved remission. This difference was significant (P = 0.048). When both radiological and histological findings were positive, the likelihood of achieving remission was significantly higher than if both modalities were negative (P = 0.038). There were significant differences between remission and failure groups when 2- and 6-week postoperative serum cortisol levels (P = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively) and 6-week postoperative urine free cortisol levels (P = 0.026) were compared. This allowed identification of patients who failed surgical treatment in the early postoperative period. Complications of surgery included transitory DI in 13, transitory CSF leak in 8 and transitory nasal discharge and cacosmia in 3. Twelve of 41 patients required some form of hormonal replacement therapy despite achieving long-term remission. Thirteen patients underwent a second operation, of whom 5 achieved remission.
Question: Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in Cushing's disease: can we predict outcome?
Thought: The question is asking if the outcome of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in Cushing's disease can be predicted based on certain factors. The context provided details the factors assessed in relation to the outcome groups of remission, failure, and relapse.
Action: Finish[Tumour identification at surgery, radiological and histological findings, postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol levels, complications of surgery, need for hormonal replacement therapy, and second operation]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long follow-up.

Relevant Context: The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcomes and patterns of failure in patients with metastatic carcinoma to cervical lymph nodes from an unknown head and neck primary origin, who were treated curatively with radiotherapy, with or without neck dissection.
The study included 61 patients referred to the McGill University Hospital Centers from 1987 to 2002. The median age was 57 years, with male to female ratio of 4:1. Distribution of patients by N status was as follows: N1, 16 patients (26%); N2a, 18 (30%); N2b, 13 (22%); N2c, 7 (11%); and N3, 7 (11%). Twenty patients underwent neck dissection (11 radical, 9 functional) and 41 patients had biopsy (9 fine-needle aspiration and 32 excisional biopsy). All patients received radiotherapy. The median dose to the involved node(s) was 64 Gy, and 60 Gy to the rest of the neck. Treatment of the neck was bilateral in 50 patients (82%) and ipsilateral in 11 (18%). The minimum duration of the follow-up was 12 months, with the median of 32 months.
The 5- and 8-year overall survival for the whole population was 79% and 67%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the 8-year actuarial overall survival (64.8% and 67.6%, respectively, p = .64) and local relapse-free survival (75% vs 74.5%, respectively, p = .57), among patients who had biopsy versus those who had neck dissection.
Question: Metastatic carcinoma to the cervical nodes from an unknown head and neck primary site: Is there a need for neck dissection?
Thought: The question is asking whether there is a need for neck dissection in patients with metastatic carcinoma to cervical nodes from an unknown head and neck primary site. Based on the study provided, it shows that there was no statistically significant difference in overall survival and local relapse-free survival between patients who had biopsy versus those who had neck dissection. Therefore, there may not be a clear need for neck dissection in these cases.
Action: Finish[No clear need for neck dissection in patients with metastatic carcinoma to cervical nodes from an unknown head and neck primary site]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: In our experience, definitive radiotherapy to the neck and the potential mucosal sites, whether preceded by neck dissection or not, is effective to achieve a good local control rate in the unknown primary cancer of the head and neck. The indication for neck dissection, in particular for early nodal stage, is controversial.

Relevant Context: As part of a prospective study on quality of life in newly diagnosed lung cancer patients an investigation was carried out to examine whether there were differences among patients' quality of life scores and their socioeconomic status.
Quality of life was measured at two points in time (baseline and three months after initial treatment) using three standard instruments; the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), the European Organization for Research and Cancer Treatment Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its lung cancer supplement (QLQ-LC13). Socioeconomic status for each individual patient was derived using Carstairs and Morris Deprivation Category ranging from 1 (least deprived) to 7 (most deprived) on the basis of the postcode sector of their address.
In all, 129 lung cancer patients entered into the study. Of these data for 82 patients were complete (at baseline and follow-up). 57% of patients were of lower socioeconomic status and they had more health problems, less functioning, and more symptoms as compared to affluent patients. Of these, physical mobility (P = 0.05), energy (P = 0.01), role functioning (P = 0.04), physical functioning (P = 0.03), and breathlessness (P = 0.02) were significant at baseline. However, at follow-up assessment there was no significant difference between patient groups nor did any consistent pattern emerge.
Question: Quality of life in lung cancer patients: does socioeconomic status matter?
Thought: The question is asking whether socioeconomic status affects the quality of life in lung cancer patients. Based on the context provided, it is evident that lower socioeconomic status is associated with more health problems, less functioning, and more symptoms in these patients. However, these differences were not significant at the follow-up assessment.
Action: Finish[Lower socioeconomic status is associated with more health problems, less functioning, and more symptoms in lung cancer patients, but these differences were not significant at the follow-up assessment.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: At baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.

Relevant Context: Neuromedin U (NmU) is a neuropeptide with anorexigenic activity. Two receptor subtypes (NmUR1 and NmUR2) confer the effects of NmU on target cells. We have recently demonstrated that NmU reduces insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets. Aim of our current study is to investigate the role of somatostatin at mediating the effects of NmU on insulin secretion.
Expression of NmU in the pancreas was detected by immunohistochemistry. Insulin and somatostatin secretion from in situ perfused rat pancreas and isolated pancreatic islets was measured by radioimmunoassay. The paracrine effects of somatostatin within pancreatic islets were blocked by cyclosomatostatin, a somatostatin receptor antagonist.
Receptor subtype NmUR1, but not NmUR2, was expressed in the endocrine pancreas, predominantly in the periphery. Neuromedin U reduced insulin secretion from in situ perfused rat pancreas and stimulated somatostatin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets. Neuromedin U stimulated somatostatin secretion at both physiological and supraphysiological glucose concentrations. Cyclosomatostatin increased insulin secretion and reduced NmU-induced inhibition of insulin secretion.
Question: Does somatostatin confer insulinostatic effects of neuromedin u in the rat pancreas?
Thought: The context provided indicates that somatostatin plays a role in mediating the effects of neuromedin U on insulin secretion in the rat pancreas. It is mentioned that somatostatin secretion is stimulated by neuromedin U and that blocking the paracrine effects of somatostatin increases insulin secretion. Therefore, somatostatin does confer insulinostatic effects of neuromedin U in the rat pancreas.
Action: Finish[Yes, somatostatin confers insulinostatic effects of neuromedin U in the rat pancreas.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Neuromedin U reduces insulin and increases somatostatin secretion. Blockade of somatostatin action abolishes the inhibition of insulin secretion by NmU. The results of the study suggest that somatostatin mediates the inhibitory action of NmU on insulin secretion.

Relevant Context: Staging laparoscopy (SL) is not regularly performed for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It may change treatment strategy, preventing unnecessary open exploration. An additional advantage of SL is possible biopsy of the nontumorous liver to assess fibrosis/cirrhosis. This study aimed to determine whether SL for patients with HCC still is useful.
Patients with HCC who underwent SL between January 1999 and December 2011 were analyzed. Their demographics, preoperative imaging studies, surgical findings, and histology were assessed.
The 56 patients (34 men and 22 women; mean age, 60 ± 14 years) in this study underwent SL for assessment of extensive disease or metastases. For two patients, SL was unsuccessful because of intraabdominal adhesions. For four patients (7.1 %), SL showed unresectability because of metastases (n = 1), tumor progression (n = 1), or severe cirrhosis in the contralateral lobe (n = 2). An additional five patients did not undergo laparotomy due to disease progression detected on imaging after SL. Exploratory laparotomy for the remaining 47 patients showed 6 (13 %) additional unresectable tumors due to advanced tumor (n = 5) or nodal metastases (n = 1). Consequently, the yield of SL was 7 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 3-17 %), and the accuracy was 27 % (95 % CI, 11-52 %). A biopsy of the contralateral liver was performed for 45 patients who underwent SL, leading to changes in management for 4 patients (17 %) with cirrhosis.
Question: Staging laparoscopy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: is it useful?
Thought: The question is asking whether staging laparoscopy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma is useful. Based on the context provided, the study found that staging laparoscopy was useful in determining unresectability due to metastases, tumor progression, or severe cirrhosis in some patients. It also allowed for biopsy of the contralateral liver, leading to changes in management for some patients with cirrhosis.
Action: Finish[Yes, staging laparoscopy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was found to be useful in determining unresectability and assessing cirrhosis, leading to changes in management for some patients.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.

Relevant Context: The proper angle of miniscrew insertion is important for cortical anchorage, patient safety, and biomechanical control. The purposes of this study are to report the alveolar process thickness and inter-radicular space in the posterior region of the mandible, to assess the impact of different miniscrew insertion angle protocols, and to identify differences between the genders or types of malocclusion.
In this retrospective study, 100 individuals were selected for orthodontic treatment at a radiology clinic. Cone-beam computed tomography data were imported into 3-dimensional software. The predictor variable was the location in the mandible and insertion angle. The demographic variables collected included age, gender, and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). The primary outcome variables were bone thickness and inter-radicular space. The inter-radicular spaces were evaluated 5 mm from the cement-enamel junction. The bone thicknesses were taken at 45°, 60°, and 90° in relation to the alveolar ridge, simulating a miniscrew insertion. These factors were evaluated for sexual dimorphism and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). Sexual dimorphism and malocclusion were evaluated with t tests. To compare the inter-radicular space and the thickness of bone between areas, an analysis of variance for repeated measures was used.
The sample was composed of 100 patients with a mean age of 17.4 ± 6.74 years. There were 61 female and 39 male patients and 60 Class I and 40 Class II molar relationships. The inter-radicular space ranged from 2.46 to 3.31 mm, and alveolar bone thickness ranged from 8.01 to 13.77 mm. The thickness tended to decrease with the increase in insertion angle from 45° to 90°. No significant differences between the genders or types of malocclusion were found.
Question: Can bone thickness and inter-radicular space affect miniscrew placement in posterior mandibular sites?
Thought: The context provided discusses the importance of bone thickness and inter-radicular space in relation to miniscrew insertion in the posterior mandibular region. Based on the information given, it is clear that bone thickness and inter-radicular space can indeed affect miniscrew placement in these sites.
Action: Finish[Yes, bone thickness and inter-radicular space can affect miniscrew placement in posterior mandibular sites.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The results of this study suggest that the safest areas for the placement of miniscrews are between the first and second premolars and between the first and second molars, regardless of the angle of insertion.

Relevant Context: To evaluate accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) in patients after oncoplastic surgery for early breast cancer.
A retrospective analysis of 136 breasts of 134 patients, who received breast-conserving oncoplastic surgery for low-risk breast cancer between 2002 and 2010 in the Universities of Vienna and Luebeck followed by adjuvant APBI applying total doses of pulse dose rate of 50.4 Gy or high-dose rate (HDR) of 32 Gy over 4 days. Target volume definition was performed by the use of surgical-free margin data, related to intraoperatively fixed clip positions, pre- and postoperative imaging, and palpation.
At the time of data acquisition, 131 of 134 patients were alive. The median follow-up time was 39 months (range, 4-106 months). After high-dose rate treatment, 3 of 89 patients showed systemic progress after a mean follow-up of 47 months (range, 19-75 months) and 2 patients had a different quadrant in-breast tumor after 27 and 35 months. One patient died 7 months after treatment of unknown causes. After pulse dose rate treatment, 1 of 45 patients had a local recurrence after 42 months and 1 patient died because of another cause after 13 months. We observed mild fibrosis in 27 breasts, telangiectasia in 6, hyperpigmentation in 14 cases, and keloid formation in 1.
Question: Is oncoplastic surgery a contraindication for accelerated partial breast radiation using the interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy method?
Thought: The context provided discusses the use of oncoplastic surgery followed by accelerated partial breast irradiation in patients with early breast cancer. Based on the information given, it does not indicate that oncoplastic surgery is a contraindication for accelerated partial breast radiation using the interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy method.
Action: Finish[No, oncoplastic surgery is not a contraindication for accelerated partial breast radiation using the interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy method]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: These preliminary results suggest the feasibility of multicatheter APBI after oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery in selected low-risk breast cancer patients; however, special attention to target volume definition is needed. Further prospective investigations with long follow-up are needed to define the real value of the procedure.

Relevant Context: To explore whether electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays can help improve prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in the TrialNet autoantibody-positive population.
TrialNet subjects who were positive for one or more autoantibodies (microinsulin autoantibody, GAD65 autoantibody [GADA], IA-2A, and ZnT8A) with available ECL-insulin autoantibody (IAA) and ECL-GADA data at their initial visit were analyzed; after a median follow-up of 24 months, 177 of these 1,287 subjects developed diabetes.
Univariate analyses showed that autoantibodies by radioimmunoassays (RIAs), ECL-IAA, ECL-GADA, age, sex, number of positive autoantibodies, presence of HLA DR3/4-DQ8 genotype, HbA1c, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measurements were all significantly associated with progression to diabetes. Subjects who were ECL positive had a risk of progression to diabetes within 6 years of 58% compared with 5% for the ECL-negative subjects (P<0.0001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were compared, with the base model including age, sex, OGTT measurements, and number of positive autoantibodies by RIAs. The model with positivity for ECL-GADA and/or ECL-IAA was the best, and factors that remained significantly associated with time to diabetes were area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide, fasting C-peptide, AUC glucose, number of positive autoantibodies by RIAs, and ECL positivity. Adding ECL to the Diabetes Prevention Trial risk score (DPTRS) improved the receiver operating characteristic curves with AUC of 0.83 (P<0.0001).
Question: Do Electrochemiluminescence Assays Improve Prediction of Time to Type 1 Diabetes in Autoantibody-Positive TrialNet Subjects?
Thought: The context provided discusses a study that analyzed the use of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays in predicting time to type 1 diabetes in TrialNet autoantibody-positive subjects. The study found that ECL positivity was significantly associated with progression to diabetes and that adding ECL to the Diabetes Prevention Trial risk score improved prediction accuracy.
Action: Finish[Yes, Electrochemiluminescence assays improve prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in autoantibody-positive TrialNet subjects.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: ECL assays improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.

Relevant Context: Minority patients with cancer experience worse control of their pain than do their white counterparts. This disparity may, in part, reflect more miscommunication between minority patients and their physicians. Therefore, we examined whether patient coaching could reduce disparities in pain control in a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.
Sixty-seven English-speaking adult cancer outpatients, including 15 minorities, with moderate pain over the prior 2 weeks were randomly assigned to the experimental (N = 34) or control group (N = 33). Experimental patients received a 20-minute individualized education and coaching session to increase knowledge of pain self-management, to redress personal misconceptions about pain treatment, and to rehearse an individually scripted patient-physician dialog about pain control. The control group received standardized information on controlling pain. Data on average pain (0-10 scale) were collected at enrollment and 2-week follow-up.
At enrollment, minority patients had significantly more pain than their white counterparts (6.0 vs 5.0, P = 0.05). At follow-up, minorities in the control group continued to have more pain (6.4 vs 4.7, P = 0.01), whereas in the experimental group, disparities were eliminated (4.0 vs 4.3, P = 0.71). The effect of the intervention on reducing disparities was significant (P = 0.04).
Question: Can patient coaching reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control?
Thought: The question is asking if patient coaching can reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control. Based on the context provided, it is clear that patient coaching was effective in reducing these disparities, as shown by the results of the study.
Action: Finish[Yes, patient coaching can reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Patient coaching offers promise as a means of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in pain control. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.

Relevant Context: To provide equality of cancer care to rural patients, Townsville Cancer Centre administers intensive chemotherapy regimens to rural patients with node-positive breast and metastatic colorectal cancers at the same doses as urban patients. Side-effects were usually managed by rural general practitioners locally.AIM: The aim is to determine the safety of this practice by comparing the profile of serious adverse events and dose intensities between urban and rural patients at the Townsville Cancer Centre.
A retrospective audit was conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal and node-positive breast cancers during a 24-month period. Fisher's exact test was used for analysis. Rurality was determined as per rural, remote and metropolitan classification.
Of the 121 patients included, 70 and 51 patients had breast and colon cancers respectively. The urban versus rural patient split among all patients, breast and colorectal cancer subgroups was 68 versus 53, 43 versus 27 and 25 versus 26 respectively. A total of 421 cycles was given with dose intensity of>95% for breast cancer in both groups (P>0.05). Rate of febrile neutropenia was 9.3% versus 7.4% (P = 0.56). For XELOX, rate of diarrhoea was 20% versus 19% (P = 0.66) and rate of vomiting was 20% versus 11% (P = 0.11). Only two patients were transferred to Townsville for admission. No toxic death occurred in either group.
Question: Is intensive chemotherapy safe for rural cancer patients?
Thought: The question is asking about the safety of intensive chemotherapy for rural cancer patients based on the context provided. The study conducted at the Townsville Cancer Centre compared the profile of serious adverse events and dose intensities between urban and rural patients. The results showed that there were no toxic deaths in either group, and the rates of febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, and vomiting were similar between urban and rural patients. Therefore, based on this information, intensive chemotherapy appears to be safe for rural cancer patients.
Action: Finish[Yes, intensive chemotherapy appears to be safe for rural cancer patients based on the study conducted at the Townsville Cancer Centre.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce the safety concerns.

Relevant Context: All VLBW infants from January 2008 to December 2012 with positive blood culture beyond 72 hours of life were enrolled in a retrospective cohort study. Newborns born after June 2010 were treated with IgM-eIVIG, 250 mg/kg/day iv for three days in addition to standard antibiotic regimen and compared to an historical cohort born before June 2010, receiving antimicrobial regimen alone. Short-term mortality (i.e. death within 7 and 21 days from treatment) was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were: total mortality, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, periventricular leukomalacia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia at discharge.
79 neonates (40 cases) were enrolled. No difference in birth weight, gestational age or SNAP II score (disease severity score) were found. Significantly reduced short-term mortality was found in treated infants (22% vs 46%; p = 0.005) considering all microbial aetiologies and the subgroup affected by Candida spp. Secondary outcomes were not different between groups.
Question: Are IgM-enriched immunoglobulins an effective adjuvant in septic VLBW infants?
Thought: The context provided describes a study comparing the outcomes of VLBW infants with sepsis treated with IgM-enriched immunoglobulins in addition to antibiotics versus those treated with antibiotics alone. The results show significantly reduced short-term mortality in infants treated with IgM-eIVIG. Therefore, based on the study findings, IgM-enriched immunoglobulins can be considered an effective adjuvant in septic VLBW infants.
Action: Finish[Yes, IgM-enriched immunoglobulins are an effective adjuvant in septic VLBW infants]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: This hypothesis-generator study shows that IgM-eIVIG is an effective adjuvant therapy in VLBW infants with proven sepsis. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm this pilot observation.

Relevant Context: Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at different loci have been associated with breast cancer susceptibility, accounting for around 10% of the familial component. Recent studies have found direct associations between specific SNPs and breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Our aim was to determine whether validated susceptibility SNP scores improve the predictive ability of risk models in comparison/conjunction to other clinical/demographic information.
Female BRCA1/2 carriers were identified from the Manchester genetic database, and included in the study regardless of breast cancer status or age. DNA was extracted from blood samples provided by these women and used for gene and SNP profiling. Estimates of survival were examined with Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were fit in the separate BRCA datasets and in menopausal stages screening different combinations of clinical/demographic/genetic variables. Nonlinear random survival forests were also fit to identify relevant interactions. Models were compared using Harrell's concordance index (1 - c-index).
548 female BRCA1 mutation carriers and 523 BRCA2 carriers were identified from the database. Median Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival was 46.0 years (44.9-48.1) for BRCA1 carriers and 48.9 (47.3-50.4) for BRCA2. By fitting Cox models and random survival forests, including both a genetic SNP score and clinical/demographic variables, average 1 - c-index values were 0.221 (st.dev. 0.019) for BRCA1 carriers and 0.215 (st.dev. 0.018) for BRCA2 carriers.
Question: Can multiple SNP testing in BRCA2 and BRCA1 female carriers be used to improve risk prediction models in conjunction with clinical assessment?
Thought: The context provided discusses the use of SNP testing in BRCA1 and BRCA2 female carriers to improve risk prediction models alongside clinical assessment. The study aimed to determine if validated susceptibility SNP scores enhance the predictive ability of risk models. Based on the information given, it seems that multiple SNP testing in conjunction with clinical assessment can indeed be used to improve risk prediction models for BRCA1 and BRCA2 female carriers.
Action: Finish[Yes, multiple SNP testing in BRCA1 and BRCA2 female carriers can be used to improve risk prediction models in conjunction with clinical assessment.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Random survival forests did not yield higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.

Relevant Context: Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy (LITT) of rat brains is associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability changes. We address the question of whether LITT-induced locoregional disruption of the BBB could possibly allow a locoregional passage of chemotherapeutic agents into brain tissue to treat malignant glioma.STUDY DESIGN/
CD Fischer rats were subject to LITT of the left forebrain. Disruption of the BBB was analyzed using Evans blue and immunohistochemistry (IH). Animals were perfused with paclitaxel, and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to analyze the content of paclitaxel in brain and plasma samples.
LITT induces an opening of the BBB as demonstrated by locoregional extravasation of Evans blue, C3C, fibrinogen, and IgM. HPLC proved the passage of paclitaxel across the disrupted BBB.
Question: Locoregional opening of the rodent blood-brain barrier for paclitaxel using Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy: a new concept of adjuvant glioma therapy?
Thought: The question is asking about the potential use of Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy to open the blood-brain barrier for paclitaxel as a new concept of adjuvant glioma therapy. Based on the context provided, it is clear that this method has been shown to induce an opening of the BBB and allow the passage of paclitaxel into brain tissue for potential treatment of malignant glioma.
Action: Finish[Yes, Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy has been demonstrated to induce an opening of the blood-brain barrier, allowing the passage of paclitaxel into brain tissue as a new concept of adjuvant glioma therapy.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: LITT induces a locoregional passage of chemotherapeutic agents into the brain tissue. This is of potential interest for the treatment of brain tumors.

Relevant Context: The benefits of serologic screening for coeliac disease in asymptomatic individuals are debatable.AIM: To investigate dietary compliance, quality of life and bone mineral density after long-term treatment in coeliac disease patients found by screening in risk groups.
The study comprised 53 consecutive screen-detected coeliac patients diagnosed 14 years (median) ago. Dietary compliance was assessed by interview, 4-day food record and serology. Quality of life was evaluated by the Psychological General Well-Being and SF-36 questionnaires, gastrointestinal symptoms by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and bone mineral density by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Comparisons were made to 44 symptom-detected-treated coeliac patients, 110 non-coeliac subjects and the general population.
A total of 96% of screen-detected and 93% of symptom-detected coeliac patients adhered to a strict or fairly strict gluten-free diet. In screen-detected patients, quality of life and gastrointestinal symptoms were similar to those in symptom-detected patients or non-coeliac controls and bone mineral density was similar to that in the general population.
Question: Is coeliac disease screening in risk groups justified?
Thought: The context provided indicates that coeliac disease screening in risk groups led to high rates of dietary compliance, similar quality of life and gastrointestinal symptoms compared to symptom-detected patients, and normal bone mineral density. Based on this information, it seems that coeliac disease screening in risk groups is justified.
Action: Finish[Yes, coeliac disease screening in risk groups is justified]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Long-term dietary compliance in screen-detected patients was good. Quality of life and bone mineral density were comparable with those in non-coeliac subjects and the general population. Active screening in coeliac disease risk groups seems to be reasonable rather than harmful.

Relevant Context: To investigate the importance of loss of consciousness (LOC) in predicting neuropsychological test performance in a large sample of patients with head injury.
Retrospective comparison of neuropsychological test results for patients who suffered traumatic LOC, no LOC, or uncertain LOC.
Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The total number of patients included in this study was 383.
Neuropsychological test measures, including the visual reproduction, digit span, and logical memory subtests of the Wechsler memory scale (revised), the Trail Making test, Wisconsin Card Sorting test, Hopkins Verbal Learning test, Controlled Oral Word Association, and the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia test (GOAT).
No significant differences were found between the LOC, no LOC, or uncertain LOC groups for any of the neuropsychological measures used. Patients who had experienced traumatic LOC did not perform more poorly on neuropsychological testing than those with no LOC or uncertain LOC. All three groups demonstrated mildly decreased performance on formal tests of speed of information processing, attentional process, and memory.
Question: Does loss of consciousness predict neuropsychological decrements after concussion?
Thought: The context provided indicates that there were no significant differences in neuropsychological test performance between patients who experienced traumatic LOC, no LOC, or uncertain LOC. Therefore, loss of consciousness does not appear to predict neuropsychological decrements after a concussion.
Action: Finish[Loss of consciousness does not predict neuropsychological decrements after concussion]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The results of this study cast doubt on the importance of LOC as a predictor of neuropsychological test performance during the acute phase of recovery from mild traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychological testing procedures have been shown to be sensitive in measuring cognitive sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in athletes. The failure of this study to find any relationship between LOC and neuropsychological functioning in a large sample of patients with mild head trauma calls into question the assignment of primary importance to LOC in grading severity of concussion. This study also does not provide support for the use of guidelines that rely heavily on LOC in making return-to-play decisions. Continued research is necessary to determine the relative importance of markers of concussion in athletes.

Relevant Context: Men appear to benefit more from being married than women with respect to mortality in middle age. However, there is some uncertainty about gender differences in mortality risks in older individuals, widowed, divorced and single individuals and about the impact of living arrangements.
Longitudinal data with 1990 census records being linked to mortality data up to 2005 were used (Swiss National Cohort). The sample comprised all residents over age 44 years in Switzerland (n=2,440,242). All-cause mortality HRs for marital status and living arrangements were estimated by Cox regression for men and women and different age groups with adjustment for education and socio-professional category.
The benefit of being married was stronger for men than for women; however, mortality patterns were similar, with higher mortality in divorced and single individuals compared with widowed individuals (<80 years). After adjustment for living arrangements, the gender difference by marital status disappeared. Stratification by living arrangement revealed that mortality risks were highest for 45-64-year-old divorced (HR 1.72 (95% CI 1.67 to 1.76)) and single men (HR 1.67 (95% CI 1.63 to 1.71)) who lived alone. In women of the same age, the highest mortality risk was observed for those who were single and living with a partner (HR 1.70 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.82)). In older age groups, the impact of marital status decreased.
Question: Marital status, living arrangement and mortality: does the association vary by gender?
Thought: The question is asking if the association between marital status, living arrangement, and mortality varies by gender. Based on the context provided, it is clear that the benefit of being married is stronger for men than for women, but after adjusting for living arrangements, the gender difference disappears. Mortality patterns are similar, with higher mortality in divorced and single individuals compared to widowed individuals. Therefore, the association between marital status, living arrangement, and mortality does vary by gender.
Action: Finish[Yes, the association between marital status, living arrangement, and mortality does vary by gender.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Evaluation of living arrangements is crucial for identifying and explaining gender differences in mortality risks by marital status. The impact of living alone and living with a partner seems to be different in men and women.

Relevant Context: The brain-dead donor supply has become one of the criteria limiting the performance of heart transplantation. Conventional screening criteria are too limiting and exclude suitable heart donors. Echocardiography is now widely available and is a reliable tool to assess left ventricular dysfunction in brain-dead donors. Yet few data are available on the degree of left ventricular dysfunction where a transplantation is possible.
Fifty-five potential brain-dead heart donors (age 38 +/- 11 years) were prospectively evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before harvesting. Fractional area change (FAC) was used to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. Transplanted hearts were evaluated on the fifth postoperative day. The transplantation was considered a success if the recipient was alive, not retransplanted, without an assistance device or an epinephrine infusion of more than 1 mg/h and showed an ejection fraction above 40%.
Of the 55 potential heart donors, 20 exhibited an FAC of less than 50%. Forty hearts were harvested, 36 of which were successfully transplanted. Nine patients had an FAC below 50% (group H2) and 27 had an FAC over 50% (group H1). Four patients died: 2 from hemorrhage (FAC>50% in donors); 1 from right and one from left ventricular dysfunction (FAC<50% in donors). The FAC increased significantly from 51 +/- 15% to 57 +/- 11% in 18 hearts that underwent TEE in donors and afterwards in recipients. Overall actuarial survival was 86.2% versus 64.6% at 1 and 2 years in group H1 and group H2, respectively (p = NS).
Question: Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in brain-dead patients: are marginally acceptable hearts suitable for transplantation?
Thought: The question is asking whether marginally acceptable hearts, as determined by transesophageal echocardiography, are suitable for transplantation. Based on the context provided, it seems that some marginally acceptable hearts were successfully transplanted, leading to improved survival rates in recipients.
Action: Finish[Yes, marginally acceptable hearts, as determined by transesophageal echocardiography, were suitable for transplantation and led to improved survival rates in recipients.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: TEE is useful to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.

Relevant Context: Infants referred to our institution with a final diagnosis of ARM were retrospectively reviewed between 2001 and 2009. The first cohort consisted of patients that were referred between November 2001 and November 2006 with the diagnosis of an ARM that had been delayed for more than 48 h. The second cohort was those referred between December 2006 and May 2009 with whom the diagnosis of ARM had not been made within 24 h of birth.
Nineteen infants were referred with delayed diagnosis of an ARM over the 7.5 years of the study. Of 44 patients referred to our institution between December 2006 and May 2009, diagnosis of an ARM was delayed more than 24 h in 14 (32%). There was no difference in gender, birth weight, prematurity, type of malformation or presence of associated anomalies between those with timely and delayed diagnosis of their ARM. A significantly greater proportion of those with a delayed diagnosis presented with obstructive symptoms (86% vs. 27%, P<0.001), including abdominal distension (57%) and delayed passage of meconium or stool (29%). Despite undergoing neonatal examination, the diagnosis of ARM was missed in 12 patients overall.
Question: Delayed diagnosis of anorectal malformations: are current guidelines sufficient?
Thought: The context provided discusses the delayed diagnosis of anorectal malformations in infants and the differences between timely and delayed diagnoses. The question asks if current guidelines are sufficient for this issue.
Action: Finish[No, current guidelines are not sufficient for the delayed diagnosis of anorectal malformations in infants based on the findings of the study.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Delayed diagnosis of an ARM appears to be common, occurring in approximately 32% of patients referred to our institution over the last 2.5 years. Current guidelines appear insufficient to ensure prompt diagnosis of ARM.

Relevant Context: The gender difference in prevalence and incidence rates of depression is one of the most consistent findings in psychiatric epidemiology. We sought to examine whether any gender differences in symptom profile might account for this difference in rates.
This study was a population-based 13-year follow-up survey of community-dwelling adults living in East Baltimore in 1981. Subjects were the continuing participants of the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program. Participants interviewed between 1993 and 1996 with complete data on depressive symptoms and covariates were included (n = 1727). We applied structural equations with a measurement model for dichotomous data (the MIMIC-multiple indicators, multiple causes-model) to compare symptoms between women and men, in relation to the nine symptom groups comprising the diagnostic criteria for major depression, adjusting for several potentially influential characteristics (namely, age, self-reported ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, and employment).
There were no significant gender differences in the self-report of depression symptoms even taking into account the higher level of depressive symptoms of women and the influence of other covariates. For example, women were no more likely to endorse sadness than were men, as evidenced by a direct effect coefficient that was not significantly different from the null [adjusted estimated direct effect of gender on report of sadness = 0.105, 95% confidence interval (-0.113, 0.323)].
Question: Are higher rates of depression in women accounted for by differential symptom reporting?
Thought: The context provided discusses a study that examined gender differences in symptom reporting related to depression. The study found that there were no significant gender differences in the self-report of depression symptoms, even when accounting for other factors. Therefore, higher rates of depression in women are not accounted for by differential symptom reporting.
Action: Finish[No, higher rates of depression in women are not accounted for by differential symptom reporting]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Men and women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was found.

Relevant Context: To assess whether it is possible for an experienced laparoscopic surgeon to perform efficient laparoscopic myomectomy regardless of the size, number, and location of the myomas.
Prospective observational study (Canadian Task Force classification II-1).
Tertiary endoscopy center.
A total of 505 healthy nonpregnant women with symptomatic myomas underwent laparoscopic myomectomy at our center. No exclusion criteria were based on the size, number, or location of myomas.
Laparoscopic myomectomy and modifications of the technique: enucleation of the myoma by morcellation while it is still attached to the uterus with and without earlier devascularization.
In all, 912 myomas were removed in these 505 patients laparoscopically. The mean number of myomas removed was 1.85 +/- 5.706 (95% CI 1.72-1.98). In all, 184 (36.4%) patients had multiple myomectomy. The mean size of the myomas removed was 5.86 +/- 3.300 cm in largest diameter (95% CI 5.56-6.16 cm). The mean weight of the myomas removed was 227.74 +/- 325.801 g (95% CI 198.03-257.45 g) and median was 100 g. The median operating time was 60 minutes (range 30-270 minutes). The median blood loss was 90 mL (range 40-2000 mL). Three comparisons were performed on the basis of size of the myomas (<10 cm and>or=10 cm in largest diameter), number of myomas removed (<or=4 and>or=5 myomas), and the technique (enucleation of the myomas by morcellation while the myoma is still attached to the uterus and the conventional technique). In all these comparisons, although the mean blood loss, duration of surgery, and hospital stay were greater in the groups in which larger myomas or more myomas were removed or the modified technique was performed as compared with their corresponding study group, the weight and size of removed myomas were also proportionately larger in these groups. Two patients were given the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma in their histopathology and 1 patient developed a diaphragmatic parasitic myoma followed by a leiomyoma of the sigmoid colon. Six patients underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy 4 to 6 years after the surgery for recurrent myomas. One conversion to laparotomy occurred and 1 patient underwent open subtotal hysterectomy for dilutional coagulopathy.
Question: Laparoscopic myomectomy: do size, number, and location of the myomas form limiting factors for laparoscopic myomectomy?
Thought: The context provided discusses a study on laparoscopic myomectomy in which no exclusion criteria were based on the size, number, or location of myomas. The study found that while larger myomas, more myomas, and certain techniques may result in greater blood loss, longer surgery duration, and hospital stay, the weight and size of removed myomas were also proportionately larger in these cases. Additionally, only two patients were diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma, and one patient developed a parasitic myoma. Overall, the study suggests that experienced laparoscopic surgeons can perform efficient laparoscopic myomectomy regardless of the size, number, and location of the myomas.
Action: Finish[Size, number, and location of myomas do not form limiting factors for laparoscopic myomectomy]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Laparoscopic myomectomy can be performed by experienced surgeons regardless of the size, number, or location of the myomas.

Relevant Context: The use of a balloon expandable stent valve includes balloon predilatation of the aortic stenosis before valve deployment. The aim of the study was to see whether or not balloon predilatation is necessary in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI).
Sixty consecutive TAVI patients were randomized to the standard procedure or to a protocol where balloon predilatation was omitted.
There were no significant differences between the groups regarding early hemodynamic results or complication rates.
Question: Can predilatation in transcatheter aortic valve implantation be omitted?
Thought: The context provided discusses a study where patients were randomized to receive TAVI with or without balloon predilatation, and there were no significant differences in outcomes between the groups. This suggests that predilatation in transcatheter aortic valve implantation can be omitted without affecting outcomes.
Action: Finish[Yes, predilatation in transcatheter aortic valve implantation can be omitted without significant differences in outcomes.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon predilatation. The reduction in the number of pacing periods required may be beneficial for the patient.

Relevant Context: To estimate changes in uterine myoma volume during pregnancy.
Review of departmental electronic perinatal database and medical records. Canadian Task Force Classification II-3.
Obstetrical ultrasound unit in an academic tertiary care center.
One hundred-seven patients diagnosed with uterine myomas during pregnancy and who had two or more obstetrical ultrasounds in different periods of pregnancy.
We analyzed the change in volume of uterine myomas between the first half of pregnancy (up until 19 weeks), third quarter (20-30 weeks), and last quarter (31 weeks to term). The volume of largest uterine myoma was calculated using the formula Volume (mm3)=Pi/6x(length mm)x(width mm)x(height mm).
The mean age of the population was 31+/-6 years. Between the first and the second study periods, the percentage of uterine myomas that decreased in size was 55.1% (95% CI: 43-66), with a mean decrease in volume of 35%+/-4%; while the percentage of uterine myomas that enlarged was 44.9% (95% CI: 34-56), with a mean increase in volume of 69%+/-11%. Between the second and the third study periods, 75% (95% CI: 56-87) became smaller, with a mean decrease in volume of 30%+/-3%; while 25% (95% CI: 13-43) enlarged, with a mean increase in volume of 102%+/-62%.
Question: Volume change of uterine myomas during pregnancy: do myomas really grow?
Thought: The context provided discusses the changes in volume of uterine myomas during pregnancy based on ultrasound measurements. It shows that a significant percentage of myomas decreased in size during pregnancy, while others enlarged. This suggests that myomas do not always grow during pregnancy.
Action: Finish[Myomas do not always grow during pregnancy]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.

Relevant Context: We observed an endoscopic abnormally in a group of children with histological esophagitis. We termed this finding "vertical lines in esophageal mucosa" (VLEM). We examined the relationship between the presence of VLEM and significant histologic changes in esophageal mucosal biopsies.
Between January 1, 1992, and August 31, 1994, the senior author (JFF) performed 255 esophageal biopsies. The procedure reports, available endoscopic photographs, and histology reports were reviewed to establish the endoscopic and histologic appearance of the esophageal mucosa. Intraepithelial cells were counted in a blind review of 42 randomly selected biopsies.
The esophageal mucosa had a normal appearance on 160 endoscopic studies (Group 1) and VLEM were the only mucosal abnormalities in 41 endoscopies (Group 2). Histology was normal in 92 of 160 biopsies (57.5%) from Group 1, and 1 of 41 biopsies (2.4%) from Group 2. Most patients in Group 2 had eosinophilic esophagitis (34 of 41, 83%, specificity 0.85, sensitivity 0.5, p>0.001) which was of moderate to severe intensity (31 of 34, 91.2%, specificity 0.88, sensitivity 0.73, p<0.001).
Question: Vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM): a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children?
Thought: The question is asking whether vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM) are a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children. Based on the context provided, it seems that the presence of VLEM is associated with significant histologic changes in esophageal mucosal biopsies, particularly with eosinophilic esophagitis.
Action: Finish[Yes, vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM) are a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children, especially when associated with eosinophilic esophagitis.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Histology usually demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation when VLEM were present. VLEM may be a highly specific endoscopic feature of esophagitis in children.

Relevant Context: To evaluate the usefulness of half-dose contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography for depicting the abdominal aorta and its major branches.
A total of 72 consecutive patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups that underwent MR angiography after receiving different concentrations (original or diluted to 50%) and total amounts (single or half-dose) of gadolinium chelate injected at different rates (1 or 0.5 mL/second). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the abdominal aorta and of the common and external iliac arteries were calculated, and two blinded readers rated the respective image qualities.
The SNR and CNR of the abdominal aorta and the common iliac artery in the 0.5 mL/second groups were statistically significantly lower than those in the 1 mL/second groups. The differences in overall image quality across the four groups were not statistically significant.
Question: Is half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography sufficient for the abdominal aorta and pelvis?
Thought: The study compared different doses and concentrations of contrast agents for MR angiography of the abdominal aorta and its branches. The results showed that the image quality was not significantly different across the groups, suggesting that half-dose contrast-enhanced MR angiography is sufficient for visualizing the abdominal aorta and pelvis.
Action: Finish[Yes, half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography is sufficient for the abdominal aorta and pelvis.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Half-dose MR angiography using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.

Relevant Context: Arterial calcification is a significant cardiovascular risk factor in hemodialysis patients. A series of factors are involved in the process of arterial calcification; however, the relationship between malnutrition and arterial calcification is still unclear.
68 hemodialysis patients were enrolled in this study. Nutrition status was evaluated using modified quantitative subjective global assessment (MQSGA). Related serum biochemical parameters were measured. And the radial artery samples were collected during the arteriovenous fistula surgeries. Hematoxylin/eosin stain was used to observe the arterial structures while Alizarin red stain to observe calcified depositions and classify calcified degree. The expressions of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and matrix Gla protein (MGP) were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot methods.
66.18% hemodialysis patients were malnutrition. In hemodialysis patients, the calcified depositions were mainly located in the medial layer of the radial arteries and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP were both increased in the calcified areas. The levels of serum albumin were negatively associated with calcification score and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP. While MQSGA score, serum phosphorus and calcium × phosphorus product showed positive relationships with calcification score and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP.
Question: Malnutrition, a new inducer for arterial calcification in hemodialysis patients?
Thought: The context provided discusses a study involving hemodialysis patients and their nutrition status in relation to arterial calcification. The study found that a significant percentage of hemodialysis patients were malnourished, and there were correlations between malnutrition, serum biochemical parameters, and the expressions of certain proteins related to arterial calcification. Based on this information, it is likely that malnutrition can indeed be considered a new inducer for arterial calcification in hemodialysis patients.
Action: Finish[Yes, malnutrition can be considered a new inducer for arterial calcification in hemodialysis patients]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Malnutrition is prevalent in hemodialysis patients and is associated with arterial calcification and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP in calcified radial arteries. Malnutrition may be a new inducer candidate for arterial calcification in hemodialysis patients.

Relevant Context: To identify the features of PMR that may predict the duration of steroid therapy, the occurrence of relapses and the late development of GCA.
Prospective cohort study of 176 patients with PMR, followed up for 5 years. Baseline factors associated with the duration of steroids therapy were identified using Cox regression. Predictors of relapse and the late development of GCA were identified using binary logistic regression.
A total of 176 patients with PMR were included, of whom 124 stopped steroids within 5 years. The probability of stopping steroids within 5 years was independently reduced by an elevated plasma viscosity (PV) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.49; 95% CI 0.29, 0.82 for a PV>or = 2.00 mPa s compared with a PV<or = 1.80 mPa s; overall P = 0.024] and by starting treatment at>15 mg prednisolone (HR = 0.63; 95% CI 0.41, 0.97; P = 0.036). Either of these independently reduced the chances of stopping steroids within a given time interval between 27 and 51%. No significant predictors of relapse were identified. Predictors of late GCA on univariable analysis were female sex [odds ratio (OR) = 8.16; 95% CI 1.06, 63.13; P = 0.044], HLA-DRB1*0101 or -*0401 alleles (OR = 4.95; 95% CI 1.05, 23.34; P = 0.043), PV>or = 2.00 mPa s compared with PV<or = 1.80 mPa s (OR = 10.64; 95% CI 1.28, 88.38; P = 0.029) and initial prednisolone dose>15 mg (OR = 4.53; 95% CI 1.61, 12.79; P = 0.004).
Question: Can the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica be predicted at disease onset?
Thought: The context provided discusses a study on patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and identifies factors that may predict the duration of steroid therapy, relapses, and the late development of giant cell arteritis (GCA). The study found that certain factors like plasma viscosity, initial prednisolone dose, sex, and specific alleles were associated with these outcomes. Therefore, based on this information, it is possible to predict the prognosis of PMR at disease onset by considering these factors.
Action: Finish[Yes, the prognosis of polymyalgia rheumatica can be predicted at disease onset based on factors such as plasma viscosity, initial prednisolone dose, sex, and specific alleles.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late GCA. Starting patients on>15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged steroid duration.

Relevant Context: Some studies suggest that open access articles are more often cited than non-open access articles. However, the relationship between open access and citations count in a discipline such as intensive care medicine has not been studied to date. The present article analyzes the effect of open access publishing of scientific articles in intensive care medicine journals in terms of citations count.
We evaluated a total of 161 articles (76% being non-open access articles) published in Intensive Care Medicine in the year 2008. Citation data were compared between the two groups up until April 30, 2011. Potentially confounding variables for citation counts were adjusted for in a linear multiple regression model.
The median number (interquartile range) of citations of non-open access articles was 8 (4-12) versus 9 (6-18) in the case of open access articles (p=0.084). In the highest citation range (>8), the citation count was 13 (10-16) and 18 (13-21) (p=0.008), respectively. The mean follow-up was 37.5 ± 3 months in both groups. In the 30-35 months after publication, the average number (mean ± standard deviation) of citations per article per month of non-open access articles was 0.28 ± 0.6 versus 0.38 ± 0.7 in the case of open access articles (p=0.043). Independent factors for citation advantage were the Hirsch index of the first signing author (β=0.207; p=0.015) and open access status (β=3.618; p=0.006).
Question: Does open access publishing increase the impact of scientific articles?
Thought: The context provided discusses a study on the impact of open access publishing on scientific articles in the field of intensive care medicine. The study found that open access articles had a higher citation count compared to non-open access articles, indicating that open access publishing does increase the impact of scientific articles.
Action: Finish[Yes, open access publishing increases the impact of scientific articles]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Open access publishing and the Hirsch index of the first signing author increase the impact of scientific articles. The open access advantage is greater for the more highly cited articles, and appears in the 30-35 months after publication.

Relevant Context: Precursor events are undesirable events that can lead to a subsequent adverse event and have been associated with postoperative mortality. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether precursor events are associated with a composite endpoint of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (death, acute renal failure, stroke, infection) in a low- to medium-risk coronary artery bypass grafting, valve, and valve plus coronary artery bypass grafting population. These events might be targets for strategies aimed at quality improvement.
The present study was a retrospective cohort design performed at the Queen Elizabeth Health Science Centre. Low- to medium-risk patients who had experienced postoperative MACE were matched 1:1 with patients who had not experienced postoperative MACE. The operative notes, for both groups, were scored by 5 surgeons to determine the frequency of 4 precursor events: bleeding, difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, repair or regrafting, and incomplete revascularization or repair. A univariate comparison of ≥1 precursor events in the matched groups was performed.
A total of 311 MACE patients (98.4%) were matched. The primary outcome occurred more frequently in the MACE group than in the non-MACE group (33% vs 24%; P = .015). The incidence of the individual events of bleeding and difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass was significantly higher in the MACE group. Those patients with a precursor event in the absence of MACE also appeared to have a greater prevalence of other important postoperative outcomes.
Question: Are intraoperative precursor events associated with postoperative major adverse events?
Thought: The context provided discusses a study that aimed to determine if intraoperative precursor events are associated with postoperative major adverse events. Based on the information given, it seems that there is indeed an association between precursor events and postoperative major adverse events.
Action: Finish[Yes, intraoperative precursor events are associated with postoperative major adverse events.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery who are exposed to intraoperative precursor events were more likely to experience a postoperative MACE. Quality improvement techniques aimed at mitigating the consequences of precursor events might improve the surgical outcomes for cardiac surgical patients.

Relevant Context: Ultrasound is currently not established for the diagnosis of fractures. The aim of this study was to compare ultrasound and X-ray beyond their use solely for the identification of fractures, i. e., for the detection of fracture type and dislocation for pediatric fracture diagnosis.
Limb bones of dead young pigs served as a model for pediatric bones. The fractured bones were examined with ultrasound, X-ray, and CT, which served as the gold standard.
162 of 248 bones were fractured. 130 fractures were identified using ultrasound, and 148 using X-ray. There were some advantages of X-ray over ultrasound in the detection of fracture type (80 correct results using X-ray, 66 correct results using ultrasound). Ultrasound, however, was superior to X-ray for dislocation identification (41 correct results using X-ray, 51 correct results using ultrasound). Both findings were not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing.
Question: Is ultrasound equal to X-ray in pediatric fracture diagnosis?
Thought: The context provided indicates that ultrasound and X-ray were compared for pediatric fracture diagnosis. While X-ray had some advantages in detecting fracture type, ultrasound was superior in identifying dislocations. However, both findings were not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing, suggesting that ultrasound is not equal to X-ray in pediatric fracture diagnosis.
Action: Finish[Ultrasound is not equal to X-ray in pediatric fracture diagnosis]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Ultrasound not only has comparable sensitivity to that of X-ray for the identification of limb fractures but is also equally effective for the diagnosis of fracture type and dislocation. Thus, ultrasound can be used as an adequate alternative method to X-ray for pediatric fracture diagnosis.

Relevant Context: An effective advance care planning programme involves an organizational wide commitment and preparedness for health service reform to embed advance care planning into routine practice. Internationally, such programmes have been implemented predominantly in aged and acute care with more recent work in primary care.
A multi-site action research was conducted over a 16-month period in 2007-2009 with three Victorian community palliative care services. Using mixed method data collection strategies to assess feasibility, we conducted a baseline audit of staff and clients; analysed relevant documents (client records, policies, procedures and quality improvement strategies) pre-implementation and post-implementation and conducted key informant interviews (n = 9).
Three community palliative care services: one regional and two metropolitan services in Victoria, Australia.
The services demonstrated that it was feasible to embed the Model into their organizational structures. Advance care planning conversations and involvement of family was an important outcome measure rather than completion rate of advance care planning documents in community settings. Services adapted and applied their own concept of community, which widened the impact of the model. Changes to quality audit processes were essential to consolidate the model into routine palliative care practice.
Question: Is an advance care planning model feasible in community palliative care?
Thought: The context provided indicates that a multi-site action research was conducted with three community palliative care services in Victoria, Australia, showing that it was feasible to embed the advance care planning model into their organizational structures. Advance care planning conversations and involvement of family were important outcomes, and services adapted the model to fit their own concept of community. Therefore, based on this information, it can be concluded that an advance care planning model is feasible in community palliative care.
Action: Finish[Yes, an advance care planning model is feasible in community palliative care]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: An advance care planning model is feasible for community palliative care services. Quality audit processes are an essential component of the Model with documentation of advance care planning discussion established as an important outcome measure.

Relevant Context: The goal of this retrospective study was to assess whether 99mTc-white blood cell (WBC) scintigraphy and upper gastrointestinal small bowel follow-through (UGI-SBFT) could exclude inflammation in children suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Of a population of 313 children who had a 99mTc-WBC scan, 130 children were studied exclusively to rule out IBD. Sixty-nine colonoscopies with biopsies were done within a short time interval of the 99mTc-WBC scans. There were also 51 controls studied with 99mTc-WBC scintigraphy.
Of the 130 children studied to exclude IBD, the final diagnosis was Crohn's disease in 27, ulcerative colitis in nine, miscellaneous colitis in 13, probably normal in 42, and normal in 39. The 99mTc-WBC scans were positive in all but three newly diagnosed Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or miscellaneous colitis children. The false-negative 99mTc-WBC studies were seen in children with mild inflammation on biopsies and normal UGI-SBFT studies. In the 46 children with a true-positive 99mTc-WBC scan, 81% (17/21) of UGI-SBFT studies were normal. In five children with equivocal UGI-SBFT studies, the 99mTc-WBC scan correctly predicted if inflammation was present in the terminal ileum.
Question: Are 99mTc leukocyte scintigraphy and SBFT studies useful in children suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease?
Thought: The question is asking about the usefulness of 99mTc leukocyte scintigraphy and SBFT studies in children with suspected inflammatory bowel disease. Based on the context provided, it seems that these studies are indeed useful in diagnosing IBD in children.
Action: Finish[Yes, 99mTc leukocyte scintigraphy and SBFT studies are useful in children suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Our results suggest that 99mTc-WBC is useful as an initial screening modality to exclude IBD, and is more sensitive than UGI-SBFT studies.

Relevant Context: Individuals with type 1 diabetes have a high risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, and it has been reported that they consume a high atherogenic diet. We examined how nutrient intake and adherence to current European nutritional recommendations evolved in a large cohort of European individuals with type 1 diabetes over a period of 7 years.SUBJECTS/
We analysed data from the EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study, a European multicentre prospective cohort study. Standardized 3-day dietary records were employed in individuals with type 1 diabetes. One thousand one hundred and two patients (553 men, 549 women, baseline age 33 ± 10 years, duration 15 ± 9 years) had complete nutritional data available at baseline and after 7 years. We calculated mean differences in reported nutrients over time and adjusted these for age, gender, HbA1c and BMI with ANOVA models.
Compared to baseline, there were minor changes in nutrients. Reported protein (-0.35% energy (en), fat (-1.07% en), saturated fat (-0.25% en) and cholesterol (-7.42 mg/1000 kcal) intakes were lower, whereas carbohydrate (+1.23% en) and fibre (+0.46 g/1000 kcal) intakes were higher at the 7-year follow-up. European recommendations for adequate nutrient intakes were followed in individuals with type 1 diabetes for protein (76% at baseline and 78% at follow-up), moderately for fat (34, 40%), carbohydrate (34, 41%) and cholesterol (39, 47%), but poorly for fibre (1.4, 2.4%) and saturated fat (11, 13%).
Question: Do European people with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet?
Thought: The context provided states that individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet, as reported in the study.
Action: Finish[Yes, individuals with type 1 diabetes in Europe have been reported to consume a high atherogenic diet.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: European individuals with type 1 diabetes consume a high atherogenic diet as few patients met recommendations for dietary fibre and saturated fat. This study showed minor changes in dietary nutrients and energy intakes over a period of 7 years. Nutrition education needs particular focus on strategies to increase dietary fibre and reduce saturated fat to exploit their potential benefit.

Relevant Context: Digoxin is a commonly used medication for heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias that has recently been suggested as a novel chemotherapeutic agent. Preclinical studies of prostate cancer (PCa) have shown anti-tumor activity with digoxin. We explore the relationship between use of digoxin and PCa risk.
Data from a population-based case-control study of incident cases aged 35-74 years at PCa diagnosis in 2002-2005 in King County, Washington were available. Controls were identified by random digit dialing and frequency matched by age. Use of digoxin was determined from in-person questionnaires regarding medical and prescription history. The relationship of digoxin use with PCa risk was evaluated with logistic regression.
One thousand one cases of PCa and 942 controls were analyzed. The prevalence of digoxin use in controls was 2.7%, and use was positively correlated with age. In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, race, PSA screening, and family history of PCa, digoxin use was associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of PCa (OR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.30-1.10). Among those with ≥3 PSA tests over the preceding 5 years (546 cases, 380 controls), digoxin use was associated with a stronger reduction of PCa risk (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.20-0.98).
Question: Is digoxin use for cardiovascular disease associated with risk of prostate cancer?
Thought: The context provided indicates that digoxin use was evaluated in relation to prostate cancer risk. The data suggests that digoxin use is associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of prostate cancer, especially in individuals who had undergone multiple PSA tests.
Action: Finish[No, digoxin use for cardiovascular disease is associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of prostate cancer, especially in individuals who had undergone multiple PSA tests.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: These data indicate digoxin use may be associated with a reduction in risk of PCa. Given the potential mechanisms by which digoxin may exert an anti-neoplastic effect and other recent studies showing a negative association between digoxin use and PCa, further research is warranted.

Relevant Context: Studies examining predictors of survival among the oldest-old have primarily focused on objective measures, such as physical function and health status. Only a few studies have examined the effect of personality traits on survival, such as optimism. The aim of this study was to examine whether an optimistic outlook predicts survival among the oldest-old.
The Danish 1905 Cohort Survey is a nationwide, longitudinal survey comprising all individuals born in Denmark in 1905. At baseline in 1998, a total of 2,262 persons aged 92 or 93 agreed to participate in the intake survey. The baseline in-person interview consisted of a comprehensive questionnaire including physical functioning and health, and a question about whether the respondent had an optimistic, neutral or pessimistic outlook on his or her own future.
During the follow-up period of 12 years (1998-2010) there were 2,239 deaths (99 %) in the 1905 Cohort Survey. Univariable analyses revealed that optimistic women and men were at lower risk of death compared to their neutral counterparts [HR 0.82, 95 % CI (0.73-0.93) and 0.81, 95 % CI (0.66-0.99), respectively]. When confounding factors such as baseline physical and cognitive functioning and disease were taken into account the association between optimism and survival weakened in both sexes, but the general pattern persisted. Optimistic women were still at lower risk of death compared to neutral women [HR 0.85, 95 % CI (0.74-0.97)]. The risk of death was also decreased for optimistic men compared to their neutral counterparts, but the effect was non-significant [HR 0.91, 95 % CI (0.73-1.13)].
Question: Optimism and survival: does an optimistic outlook predict better survival at advanced ages?
Thought: The question is asking whether an optimistic outlook predicts better survival at advanced ages. Based on the context provided, it is clear that an optimistic outlook does predict better survival among the oldest-old.
Action: Finish[Yes, an optimistic outlook does predict better survival at advanced ages among the oldest-old]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: An optimistic outlook appears to be a significant predictor of survival among the oldest-old women. It may also be a significant predictor for men but the sample size is small.

Relevant Context: To compare the dose intensity and toxicity profiles for patients undergoing chemotherapy at the Townsville Cancer Centre (TCC), a tertiary cancer centre in northern Queensland, with those for patients treated in Mount Isa, supervised by the same medical oncologists via teleoncology.
A quasi-experimental design comparing two patient groups.
TCC and Mount Isa Hospital, which both operate under the auspices of the Townsville Teleoncology Network (TTN).
Eligible patients who received chemotherapy at TCC or Mt Isa Hospital between 1 May 2007 and 30 April 2012.
Teleoncology model for managing cancer patients in rural towns.
Dose intensity (doses, number of cycles and lines of treatment) and toxicity rates (rate of serious side effects, hospital admissions and mortality).
Over 5 years, 89 patients received a total of 626 cycles of various chemotherapy regimens in Mount Isa. During the same period, 117 patients who received a total of 799 cycles of chemotherapy at TCC were eligible for inclusion in the comparison group. There were no significant differences between the Mount Isa and TCC patients in most demographic characteristics, mean numbers of treatment cycles, dose intensities, proportions of side effects, and hospital admissions. There were no toxicity-related deaths in either group.
Question: Do teleoncology models of care enable safe delivery of chemotherapy in rural towns?
Thought: The context provided describes a study comparing the delivery of chemotherapy in rural towns using a teleoncology model. Based on the results presented, it seems that the teleoncology model enabled safe delivery of chemotherapy in both Mount Isa and TCC, with no significant differences in toxicity rates, hospital admissions, or mortality between the two groups.
Action: Finish[Yes, teleoncology models of care enable safe delivery of chemotherapy in rural towns based on the study results comparing TCC and Mount Isa Hospital.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: It appears safe to administer chemotherapy in rural towns under the supervision of medical oncologists from larger centres via teleoncology, provided that rural health care resources and governance arrangements are adequate.

Relevant Context: To examine the ability of various postoperative nomograms to predict prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and to validate that they could predict aggressive biochemical recurrence (BCR). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), grade, and stage are the classic triad used to predict BCR after radical prostatectomy (RP). Multiple nomograms use these to predict risk of BCR. A previous study showed that several nomograms could predict aggressive BCR (prostate-specific antigen doubling time [PSADT] <9 months) more accurately than BCR. However, it remains unknown if they can predict more definitive endpoints, such as PCSM.
We performed Cox analyses to examine the ability of 4 postoperative nomograms, the Duke Prostate Center (DPC) nomogram, the Kattan postoperative nomogram, the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) nomogram, and the joint Center for Prostate Disease Research(CPDR)/Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) nomogram to predict BCR and PCSM among 1778 men in the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database who underwent RP between 1990 and 2009. We also compared their ability to predict BCR and aggressive BCR in a subset of men. We calculated the c-index for each nomogram to determine its predictive accuracy for estimating actual outcomes.
We found that each nomogram could predict aggressive BCR and PCSM in a statistically significant manner and that they all predicted PCSM more accurately than they predicted BCR (ie, with higher c-index values).
Question: Do nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) do a better job of predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR?
Thought: The context provided indicates that the nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) were able to predict more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes, such as prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), more accurately than they predicted BCR itself.
Action: Finish[Yes, nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) were able to predict more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes, such as prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), more accurately than they predicted BCR itself.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Currently available nomograms used to predict BCR accurately predict PCSM and other more clinically relevant endpoints. Moreover, not only do they significantly predict PCSM, but do so with generally greater accuracy than BCR.

Relevant Context: The accepted treatment protocol for necrotizing fasciitis (NF) consists of extensive surgery and wide spectrum antibiotics. Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) has been recommended as adjuvant therapy for NF, improving patient mortality and outcome. However, the beneficial effect of HBO for NF remains controversial.
A retrospective evaluation of treatment outcome in 37 patients treated for NF between 1984 and 1993 was carried out. The mortality rate, morbidity criteria, and risk factors for grave prognosis were compared between a group of 25 patients who received HBO as part of their treatment protocol and a group of the remaining 12 patients treated by surgical excision and antibiotics alone.
The two groups were found to be similar with regard to age, gender, the incidence of individual risk factors for ominous prognosis, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score for disease's severity on presentation. The mortality rate among the HBO-treated patients was 36%, as opposed to 25% in the non-HBO group. The mean number of surgical débridements required per patient was significantly higher in the HBO group: 3.3 compared with 1.5 in the non-HBO-treated patients. Although the average length of hospitalization for survivors was shorter for the HBO group, the difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance.
Question: Necrotizing fasciitis: an indication for hyperbaric oxygenation therapy?
Thought: The question is asking whether hyperbaric oxygenation therapy is indicated for necrotizing fasciitis based on the context provided. The study showed that while HBO treatment did not significantly reduce mortality rates, it did require more surgical procedures per patient. The difference in hospitalization length was not statistically significant.
Action: Finish[Not a clear indication for hyperbaric oxygenation therapy for necrotizing fasciitis based on the study results]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for NF.

Relevant Context: This study examined changes in the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies by U.S. adults aged 18 years or older with chronic disease-related functional limitations between 2002 and 2007.
The study was a cross-sectional survey.SETTING/
The study was conducted in the United States.
The study comprised adults aged 18 years or older with chronic disease-related functional limitations.
Data were obtained from the 2002 and 2007 U.S. National Health Interview Survey to compare the use of 22 CAM therapies (n=9313 and n=7014, respectively). Estimates were age adjusted to the year 2000 U.S. standard population.
The unadjusted and age-standardized prevalence of overall CAM use (22 therapies comparable between both survey years) was higher in 2007 than in 2002 (30.6% versus 26.9%, p<0.001 and 34.4% versus 30.6%, p<0.001, respectively). Adults with functional limitations that included changing and maintaining body position experienced a significant increase in CAM use between 2002 and 2007 (31.1%-35.0%, p<0.01). The use of deep breathing exercises was the most prevalent CAM therapy in both 2002 and 2007 and increased significantly during this period (from 17.9% to 19.9%, p<0.05). The use of meditation, massage, and yoga also increased significantly from 2002 and 2007 (11.0%-13.5%, p<0.01; 7.0%-10.9%, p<0.0001; and 5.1% to 6.6%, p<0.05, respectively), while the use of the Atkins diet decreased (2.2%- 1.4%, p<0.01).
Question: Has the use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies by U.S. adults with chronic disease-related functional limitations changed from 2002 to 2007?
Thought: The question is asking about changes in the use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies by U.S. adults with chronic disease-related functional limitations between 2002 and 2007. Based on the context provided, I can see that the overall CAM use increased from 26.9% in 2002 to 30.6% in 2007, with specific therapies like deep breathing exercises, meditation, massage, and yoga also showing significant increases during this period.
Action: Finish[Yes, the use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies by U.S. adults with chronic disease-related functional limitations increased from 2002 to 2007, with overall CAM use and specific therapies like deep breathing exercises, meditation, massage, and yoga showing significant increases.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Among U.S. adults with chronic disease-related functional limitations, the overall increase in CAM use from 2002 to 2007 was significant, particularly among those with changing and maintaining body position limitations.

Relevant Context: The objective of the current study is to determine to what extent the reduction of Chile's traffic fatalities and injuries during 2000-2012 was related to the police traffic enforcement increment registered after the introduction of its 2005 traffic law reform.
A unique dataset with assembled information from public institutions and analyses based on ordinary least square and robust random effects models was carried out. Dependent variables were traffic fatality and severe injury rates per population and vehicle fleet. Independent variables were: (1) presence of new national traffic law; (2) police officers per population; (3) number of traffic tickets per police officer; and (4) interaction effect of number of traffic tickets per police officer with traffic law reform. Oil prices, alcohol consumption, proportion of male population 15-24 years old, unemployment, road infrastructure investment, years' effects and regions' effects represented control variables.
Empirical estimates from instrumental variables suggest that the enactment of the traffic law reform in interaction with number of traffic tickets per police officer is significantly associated with a decrease of 8% in traffic fatalities and 7% in severe injuries. Piecewise regression model results for the 2007-2012 period suggest that police traffic enforcement reduced traffic fatalities by 59% and severe injuries by 37%.
Question: Did Chile's traffic law reform push police enforcement?
Thought: The context provided indicates that the study found a significant association between the enactment of Chile's traffic law reform and the increase in police traffic enforcement with a decrease in traffic fatalities and severe injuries. Therefore, it can be concluded that Chile's traffic law reform did push police enforcement.
Action: Finish[Yes, Chile's traffic law reform did push police enforcement]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Findings suggest that traffic law reforms in order to have an effect on both traffic fatality and injury rates reduction require changes in police enforcement practices. Last, this case also illustrates how the diffusion of successful road safety practices globally promoted by WHO and World Bank can be an important influence for enhancing national road safety practices.

Relevant Context: Several atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) are used as second-line agents for treatment resistant depression. AAPs can be expensive compared to other treatment options and can cause several side effects.
To estimate healthcare costs and utilization of AAPs compared to other second-line agents.
Observational study using Medicaid claims data (2006-2011). Subjects were depression-diagnosed adult members with at least two prescriptions of antidepressant medications followed by a second-line agent. Gamma generalized linear models (GLM) produced estimates of the difference in mean expenditures among treatment groups after adjusting for individual baseline characteristics using propensity scores. Negative binomial models produced estimates of the difference in number of hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits.
A total of 3910 members received second-line treatment. Treatment groups were AAPs (n = 2211), augmentation agents other than AAPs (n = 1008), and antidepressant switching (n = 691). AAPs resulted in higher mean adjusted pharmacy costs and higher mean adjusted total mental health-related costs. Mean adjusted total healthcare costs and number of inpatient and ED visits were not different among treatments.
Question: Does the use of atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive therapy in depression result in cost savings?
Thought: The study compared the healthcare costs and utilization of atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) to other second-line agents in the treatment of depression. Based on the results provided, it seems that the use of AAPs did not result in cost savings compared to other treatment options.
Action: Finish[No, the use of atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive therapy in depression did not result in cost savings compared to other second-line agents.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The results show no evidence that AAPs used as second-line treatment for depression results in overall cost savings or lower inpatient and ED visits compared to other treatment strategies.

Relevant Context: Low intakes or blood levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA + DHA) are independently associated with increased risk of death from coronary heart disease (CHD). In randomized secondary prevention trials, fish or fish oil have been demonstrated to reduce total and CHD mortality at intakes of about 1 g/day. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid (FA) composition reflects long-term intake of EPA + DHA. We propose that the RBC EPA + DHA (hereafter called the Omega-3 Index) be considered a new risk factor for death from CHD.
We conducted clinical and laboratory experiments to generate data necessary for the validation of the Omega-3 Index as a CHD risk predictor. The relationship between this putative marker and risk for CHD death, especially sudden cardiac death (SCD), was then evaluated in several published primary and secondary prevention studies.
The Omega-3 Index was inversely associated with risk for CHD mortality. An Omega-3 Index of>or = 8% was associated with the greatest cardioprotection, whereas an index of<or = 4% was associated with the least.
Question: The Omega-3 Index: a new risk factor for death from coronary heart disease?
Thought: The context provided discusses the Omega-3 Index as a potential new risk factor for death from coronary heart disease. Based on the information given, it is clear that the Omega-3 Index is indeed being proposed as a new risk factor for death from CHD.
Action: Finish[Yes, the Omega-3 Index is being proposed as a new risk factor for death from coronary heart disease.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The Omega-3 Index may represent a novel, physiologically relevant, easily modified, independent, and graded risk factor for death from CHD that could have significant clinical utility.

Relevant Context: To compare the accuracy achieved by a trained urology nurse practitioner (UNP) and consultant urologist in detecting bladder tumours during flexible cystoscopy.
Eighty-three patients underwent flexible cystoscopy by both the UNP and consultant urologist, each unaware of the other's findings. Before comparing the findings, each declared whether there was tumour or any suspicious lesion requiring biopsy.
Of 83 patients examined by flexible cystoscopy, 26 were found to have a tumour or a suspicious lesion. One tumour was missed by the UNP and one by the urologist; each tumour was minute. Analysis using the chance-corrected proportional agreement (Kappa) was 0.94, indicating very close agreement.
Question: The nurse cystoscopist: a feasible option?
Thought: Based on the context provided, it seems that the nurse cystoscopist is a feasible option for detecting bladder tumors during flexible cystoscopy.
Action: Finish[Yes, the nurse cystoscopist is a feasible option based on the high agreement level with the consultant urologist in detecting bladder tumors during flexible cystoscopy.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: A UNP can be trained to perform cystoscopy and detect suspicious lesions as accurately as can a consultant urologist. Legal and training issues in implementation are important.

Relevant Context: Sternal fractures in childhood are rare. The aim of the study was to investigate the accident mechanism, the detection of radiological and sonographical criteria and consideration of associated injuries.
In the period from January 2010 to December 2012 all inpatients and outpatients with sternal fractures were recorded according to the documentation.
A total of 4 children aged 5-14 years with a sternal fracture were treated in 2 years, 2 children were hospitalized for pain management and 2 remained in outpatient care.
Question: Sternal fracture in growing children : A rare and often overlooked fracture?
Thought: The context provided indicates that sternal fractures in childhood are indeed rare.
Action: Finish[True]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Isolated sternal fractures in childhood are often due to typical age-related traumatic incidents. Ultrasonography is a useful diagnostic tool for fracture detection and radiography is the method of choice for visualization of the extent of the dislocation.

Relevant Context: To examine the clinical effect (efficacy and tolerability) of high doses of zonisamide (ZNS) (>500 mg/d) in adult patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy.
Between 2006 and 2013, all epileptic outpatients treated with high doses of ZNS were selected. Safety and efficacy were assessed based on patient and caregiver reports. Serum levels of ZNS and other concomitant antiepileptic drugs were evaluated if available.
Nine patients (5 female): 8 focal/1 generalized pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Mean age: 34 years. Most frequent seizure type: complex partial seizures; other seizure types: generalized tonic-clonic, tonic, myoclonia. Zonisamide in polytherapy in all (100%), administered in tritherapy in 3 (33%) of 9 patients; mean dose: 633 (600-700) mg/d; efficacy (>50% seizure reduction) was observed in 5 (55%) of 9 patients. Five of 9 patients are still taking high doses of ZNS (more than 1 year). Adverse events were observed in 3 (37%) of 8 patients. Good tolerance to high doses of other antiepileptic drugs had been observed in 6 (66%) of 9 patients. Plasma levels of ZNS were only available in 2 patients; both were in the therapeutic range (34.95, 30.91) (10-40 mg/L).
Question: Could Adult European Pharmacoresistant Epilepsy Patients Be Treated With Higher Doses of Zonisamide?
Thought: The context provided describes a study where adult patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy were treated with high doses of zonisamide, showing some efficacy and tolerability. Based on this information, it seems that adult European pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients could potentially be treated with higher doses of zonisamide, as it has shown some positive results in this study.
Action: Finish[Yes, adult European pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients could potentially be treated with higher doses of zonisamide based on the positive efficacy and tolerability observed in the study mentioned.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: High doses of ZNS are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.

Relevant Context: The use of three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound may help to determine the exact position of the needle during breast biopsy, thereby reducing the number of core samples that are needed to achieve a reliable histological diagnosis. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of 3D ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy (LCNB) of the breast.
A total of 360 core needle biopsies was obtained from 169 breast lesions in 146 patients. Additional open breast biopsy was performed in 111 women (127/169 breast lesions); the remaining 42 lesions were followed up for at least 24 months. 3D ultrasound visualization of the needle in the postfiring position was used to classify the biopsy as central, marginal or outside the lesion. Based on this classification it was decided whether another sample had to be obtained.
A median of two core samples per lesion provided for all the lesions a sensitivity for malignancy of 96.9%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0% and false-negative rate of 3.1%, and for the excised lesions a sensitivity of 96.5%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0%, false-negative rate of 3.5% and an underestimation rate of 3.4%.
Question: Three-dimensional ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy: is it a reliable method for the histological assessment of breast lesions?
Thought: The context provided discusses the efficacy of three-dimensional ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy for histological assessment of breast lesions. Based on the results mentioned, it seems that this method is indeed reliable for accurately diagnosing breast lesions.
Action: Finish[Yes, three-dimensional ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy is a reliable method for the histological assessment of breast lesions.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 3D ultrasound validation of the postfiring needle position is an efficient adjunct to ultrasound-guided LCNB. The advantages of 3D ultrasound validation are likely to include a reduction in the number of core samples needed to achieve a reliable histological diagnosis (and a possible reduction in the risk of tumor cell displacement), reduced procedure time and lower costs.

Relevant Context: The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of ultrasonography to confirm Schanz pin placement in a cadaveric model, and the interobserver repeatability of the ultrasound methodology.
This investigation is a repeated measures cadaveric study with multiple examiners.
Cadaveric preparation and observations were done by an orthopaedic traumatologist and resident, and two general surgery traumatologists.
A total of 16 Schanz pins were equally placed in bilateral femora and tibiae. Four examiners took measurements of pin protrusion beyond the distal cortices using first ultrasonography and then by direct measurement after gross dissection.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Distal Schanz pin protrusion length measurements from both ultrasonography and direct measurement post dissection.
Schanz pin protrusion measurements are underestimated by ultrasonography (p<0.01) by an average of 10 percent over the range of 5 to 18 mm, and they display a proportional bias that increases the under reporting as the magnitude of pin protrusion increases. Ultrasound data demonstrate good linear correlation and closely represent actual protrusion values in the 5 to 12 mm range. Interobserver repeatability analysis demonstrated that all examiners were not statistically different in their measurements despite minimal familiarity with the ultrasound methodology (p>0.8).
Question: Is portable ultrasonography accurate in the evaluation of Schanz pin placement during extremity fracture fixation in austere environments?
Thought: The question is asking about the accuracy of portable ultrasonography in evaluating Schanz pin placement during extremity fracture fixation in austere environments. Based on the context provided, the study found that ultrasonography underestimates Schanz pin protrusion measurements by an average of 10 percent over a certain range, but displays good linear correlation and closely represents actual protrusion values in a specific range. Additionally, interobserver repeatability analysis showed that all examiners were not statistically different in their measurements despite minimal familiarity with the ultrasound methodology.
Action: Finish[Yes, portable ultrasonography is accurate in the evaluation of Schanz pin placement during extremity fracture fixation in austere environments, as it demonstrates good linear correlation and closely represents actual protrusion values within a specific range.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Despite the statistical imparity of pin protrusion measurement via ultrasound compared to that of gross dissection, a consideration of the clinical relevance of ultrasound measurement bias during an austere operating theatre leads to the conclusion that ultrasonography is an adequate methodology for Schanz pin protrusion measurement.

Relevant Context: Beating-heart valve surgery appears to be a promising technique for protection of hypertrophied hearts. Normothermic normokalemic simultaneous antegrade/retrograde perfusion (NNSP) may improve myocardial perfusion. However, its effects on myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism remain unclear. The present study was to determine whether NNSP improved myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism of hypertrophied hearts relative to normothermic normokalemic antegrade perfusion (NNAP).
Twelve hypertrophied pig hearts underwent a protocol consisting of three 20-minute perfusion episodes (10 minutes NNAP and 10 minutes NNSP in a random order) with each conducted at a different blood flow in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD [100%, 50%, and 20% of its initial control]). Myocardial oxygenation was assessed using near-infrared spectroscopic imaging. Myocardial energy metabolism was monitored using localized phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
With 100% LAD flow, both NNAP and NNSP maintained myocardial oxygenation, adenosine triphosphate, phosphocreatine, and inorganic phosphate at normal levels. When LAD flow was reduced to 50% of its control level, NNSP resulted in a small but significant decrease in myocardial oxygenation and phosphocreatine, whereas those measurements did not change significantly during NNAP. With LAD flow further reduced to 20% of its control level, both NNAP and NNSP caused a substantial decrease in myocardial oxygenation, adenosine triphosphate, and phosphocreatine with an increase in inorganic phosphate. However, the changes were significantly greater during NNSP than during NNAP.
Question: Does normothermic normokalemic simultaneous antegrade/retrograde perfusion improve myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism for hypertrophied hearts?
Thought: The question is asking whether normothermic normokalemic simultaneous antegrade/retrograde perfusion improves myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism for hypertrophied hearts. Based on the context provided, it is clear that NNSP does not consistently improve myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism compared to NNAP, especially at lower levels of blood flow in the left anterior descending coronary artery.
Action: Finish[NNSP does not consistently improve myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism for hypertrophied hearts compared to NNAP, especially at lower levels of blood flow in the left anterior descending coronary artery.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Normothermic normokalemic simultaneous antegrade/retrograde perfusion did not improve, but slightly impaired myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism of beating hypertrophied hearts relative to NNAP. Therefore, NNSP for protection of beating hypertrophied hearts during valve surgery should be used with extra caution.

Relevant Context: The study was performed to evaluate the clinical and technical efficacy of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) of small saphenous varicosities, particularly in relation to the site of endovenous access.
Totally 59 patients with unilateral saphenopopliteal junction incompetence and small saphenous vein reflux underwent EVLA (810 nm, 14 W diode laser) with ambulatory phlebectomies. Small saphenous vein access was gained at the lowest site of truncal reflux. Patients were divided into 2 groups: access gained above mid-calf (AMC, n = 33) and below mid-calf (BMC, n = 26) levels. Outcomes included Venous Clinical Severity Scores (VCSS), Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), patient satisfaction, complications, and recurrence rates.
Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in VCSS, AVVQ, generic quality of life Short Form 36, and EuroQol scores (P<.05) up to 1 year. No differences were seen between AMC and BMC groups for complications (phlebitis: 2 [6%] and 1 [3.8%], P>.05; paresthesia: 2 [6%] and 5 [19%], P = .223) and recurrence (3 [9%] and 1 [3.8%], P = .623), respectively.
Question: Endovenous laser ablation in the treatment of small saphenous varicose veins: does site of access influence early outcomes?
Thought: The question is asking if the site of access for endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) in the treatment of small saphenous varicose veins influences early outcomes. Based on the context provided, it seems that there were no significant differences in outcomes between the groups with access gained above mid-calf (AMC) and below mid-calf (BMC) levels.
Action: Finish[No, the site of access did not influence early outcomes]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The site of access in our study does not appear to influence complications specifically neural injury or recurrence rates.

Relevant Context: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is undiagnosed in approximately half of the patients actually suffering from the disease. In addition, the prevalence of DM is more than twice as high as in patients with periodontitis when compared to periodontally healthy subjects. Thus, a high number of patients with periodontitis may have undiagnosed DM. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether blood oozing from a gingival crevice during routine periodontal examination can be used for determining glucose levels.
Observational cross-sectional studies were carried out in 75 patients (43 males and 32 females) with chronic periodontitis who were divided into two groups: Group I and Group II, respectively. Blood oozing from the gingival crevices of anterior teeth following periodontal probing was collected with the stick of glucose self-monitoring device, and the blood glucose levels were measured. At the same time, finger-prick blood was taken for glucometric analysis and subsequent readings were recorded.
The patient's blood glucose values ranged from 74 to 256 mg/dl. The comparison between gingival crevicular blood and finger-prick blood showed a very strong correlation, with a t value of 3.97 (at P value = 0.001).
Question: Can gingival crevicular blood be relied upon for assessment of blood glucose level?
Thought: The context provided indicates that there is a strong correlation between blood glucose levels measured from gingival crevicular blood and finger-prick blood. This suggests that gingival crevicular blood can be relied upon for the assessment of blood glucose levels.
Action: Finish[Yes, gingival crevicular blood can be relied upon for the assessment of blood glucose levels]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The data from this study has shown that GCB collected during diagnostic periodontal examination can be an excellent source of blood for glucometric analysis.

Relevant Context: In a prospective study 218 preschool children were enrolled (stratified in 2 training programs, one specialized for phonologic awareness in order to prevent dyslexia, the other consisting in training of general perception) during the last year of kindergarten. After finishing the first grade 131 children were compared in their reading and writing abilities.
In the whole group only a slight difference was found between both training modalities concerning their writing abilities. However, children with a history of hearing loss, actual hearing loss or pathologic middle ear findings profited most from the specialized training program compared to the control in their reading abilities.
Question: Is a specialised training of phonological awareness indicated in every preschool child?
Thought: The context indicates that children with a history of hearing loss, actual hearing loss, or pathologic middle ear findings benefited most from the specialized training program in reading abilities. Therefore, a specialized training of phonological awareness may not be indicated in every preschool child, but rather in those with specific risk factors such as hearing issues.
Action: Finish[No, a specialized training of phonological awareness is not indicated in every preschool child, but rather in those with specific risk factors such as hearing issues.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: A specialized training program to improve phonologic awareness as a basis for reading and writing in every kindergarten and preschool child seems to be unnecessary. However, children with temporary hearing deficits benefit from such a program. For all other children general perception training may be sufficient.

Relevant Context: To explore whether early treatment would shorten the duration of headache from headache onset to its peak and reduce headache severity at peak.
Prior clinical studies almost exclusively focused on headache relief after dosing. No data are available on whether early intervention affects the duration from headache onset to peak and headache severity at peak.
Adult migraineurs were enrolled in this observational study from multi-site headache clinics. Patients recorded their migraine experiences via an electronic diary over 1 month. Patients reported the time and pain severity at onset, dosing, and peak. We used a linear mixed model to evaluate the impact of the timing of treatment and to adjust for covariates and correlation of observations within subjects.
A total of 182 patients reported 970 migraine episodes, 620 of which were treated before headaches progressed to peak. Mean time from headache onset to peak varied from 1.9 hours to 8.9 hours for patients treated within 15 minutes of onset and those who waited for 4 or more hours, respectively. However, early intervention was not associated with reduced headache severity at peak. In multivariate analysis, early treatment, use of triptans, and mild migraine headache in the past 3 months were significantly associated with shorter time from onset to headache peak. A separate model indicated that the timing of medication was not associated with the duration between dosing and headache peak, but use of triptans shortened the time from dosing to headache peak.
Question: Does early migraine treatment shorten time to headache peak and reduce its severity?
Thought: The context provided indicates that early treatment for migraines was associated with a shorter time from headache onset to peak, but it was not linked to reduced headache severity at peak. Triptans and mild migraine headache history were factors significantly associated with a shorter time to headache peak.
Action: Finish[Yes, early migraine treatment shortens time to headache peak but does not reduce its severity at peak. Triptans and mild migraine headache history were factors significantly associated with a shorter time to headache peak.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Early treatment and use of triptans may lead to shorter duration from migraine headache onset to its peak but did not alleviate headache severity at peak. This could result in decreased migraine burden by reducing total migraine headache duration.

Relevant Context: Research on stroke survivors' driving safety has typically used either self-reports or government records, but the extent to which the 2 may differ is not known. We compared government records and self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions in a sample of stroke survivors.
The 56 participants were originally recruited for a prospective study on driving and community re-integration post-stroke; the study population consisted of moderately impaired stroke survivors without severe communication disorders who had been referred for a driving assessment. The driving records of the 56 participants for the 5 years before study entry and the 1-year study period were acquired with written consent from the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), Canada. Self-reports of collisions and convictions were acquired via a semistructured interview and then compared with the MTO records.
Forty-three participants completed the study. For 7 (13.5%) the MTO records did not match the self-reports regarding collision involvement, and for 9 (17.3%) the MTO records did not match self-reports regarding driving convictions. The kappa coefficient for the correlation between MTO records and self-reports was 0.52 for collisions and 0.47 for convictions (both in the moderate range of agreement). When both sources of data were consulted, up to 56 percent more accidents and up to 46 percent more convictions were identified in the study population in the 5 years before study entry compared to when either source was used alone.
Question: Department of Transportation vs self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors: do they agree?
Thought: The question is asking about the agreement between Department of Transportation records and self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors. Based on the context provided, there is moderate agreement between the two sources of data, with discrepancies found in a significant percentage of cases.
Action: Finish[Moderate agreement between Department of Transportation records and self-reported data on motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions for stroke survivors]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.

Relevant Context: All currently available atypical antipsychotics have, at clinically relevant doses: i) high serotonin (5-HT)2 occupancy; ii) greater 5-HT2 than dopamine (D)2 occupancy; and iii) a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects when their D2 occupancy exceeds 80%. A review of pharmacologic and behavioral data suggested that amoxapine should also conform to this profile; therefore, we undertook a positron-emission tomography (PET) study of its 5-HT2 and D2 occupancy.
Seven healthy volunteers received 50-250 mg/day of amoxapine for 5 days and then had [11C]-raclopride and [18F]-setoperone PET scans.
5-HT2 receptors showed near saturation at doses of 100 mg/day and above. The D2 receptor occupancies showed a dose-dependent increase, never exceeding 80%; at all doses 5-HT2 occupancy exceeded D2 occupancy.
Question: Is amoxapine an atypical antipsychotic?
Thought: Based on the context provided, amoxapine conforms to the profile of atypical antipsychotics with high serotonin (5-HT)2 occupancy, greater 5-HT2 than dopamine (D)2 occupancy, and a lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects when D2 occupancy is below 80%. Therefore, amoxapine can be classified as an atypical antipsychotic.
Action: Finish[Yes, amoxapine is an atypical antipsychotic]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an "atypical" antipsychotic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.

Relevant Context: Optimization of the preoperative hemoglobin (Hb) level is an effective way to reduce allogeneic transfusion in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) though the procedure is expensive, requires close monitoring and is often inconvenient for patients with reduced mobility. Our aim was to investigate the value of preoperative Hb levels to predict transfusion and thereby tailoring Hb optimization to patient characteristics.
All consecutive patients who undergone primary TKA in our center over 2 years, and received tranexamic acid intraoperatively, were reviewed. The adjusted association between preoperative Hb levels and transfusion was assessed by multivariate logistic regression, and the estimated probability of transfusion for individual patients was derived from the logistic model.
Out of the 784 patients who meet the inclusion criteria, risk of transfusion was associated with poorer performance status, as measured by the America Association of Anestesiology (ASA) score III/IV (OR: 3·3, P < 0·001) and lower preoperative Hb level (OR 3·8 for each g/dl below 13 g/dl; P < 0·001). According to the Hb level, the estimated probability of transfusion was 0·03 (range: 0·03-0·64) for ASA I/II patients and 0·10 (range: 0·10-0·84) for ASA III/IV.
Question: Should all patients be optimized to the same preoperative hemoglobin level to avoid transfusion in primary knee arthroplasty?
Thought: The context provided indicates that the risk of transfusion is associated with lower preoperative Hb levels. Therefore, tailoring Hb optimization to patient characteristics, such as performance status, is important in predicting transfusion. This suggests that not all patients should be optimized to the same preoperative hemoglobin level to avoid transfusion in primary knee arthroplasty.
Action: Finish[Tailoring Hb optimization to patient characteristics is important in predicting transfusion, so not all patients should be optimized to the same preoperative hemoglobin level in primary knee arthroplasty.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Not all the patients undergoing TKA who receive tranexamic acid need the same preoperative Hb optimization target. Two easily available factors, such as the ASA score and the Hb level, can help individualize the Hb optimization target.

Relevant Context: Treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus in children with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) depends on the level of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) block. Air-encephalography is regarded as the gold standard for differentiating communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus. Since air-encephalography involves a lumbar puncture, it carries the risk of cerebral herniation. AIM. The aim of this study was to determine whether communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus in TBM can be differentiated by means of cranial computerised tomography (CT).
A number of CT indices were measured in 50 children with communicating and 34 children with non-communicating hydrocephalus according to air-encephalographic findings.
The only CT finding that correlated with the type of hydrocephalus was the shape of the third ventricle. Significantly more children with non-communicating hydrocephalus had a rounded third ventricle than those with communicating hydrocephalus.
Question: Can CT predict the level of CSF block in tuberculous hydrocephalus?
Thought: The question is asking if CT can predict the level of CSF block in tuberculous hydrocephalus. Based on the context provided, it seems that CT findings, specifically the shape of the third ventricle, can differentiate between communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus, but it may not be able to predict the exact level of CSF block.
Action: Finish[CT findings can differentiate between communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus in tuberculous meningitis, but may not predict the exact level of CSF block.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: CT is therefore not useful in determining the level of CSF block in TBM. Air-encephalography remains the most reliable way of determining the level of CSF obstruction.

Relevant Context: Stock et al. (Eur Respir J 25:47-53, 2005) recently estimated asthma prevalence in Germany using claims data on prescriptions and hospital diagnoses and found high prevalence peaks in infants. Our objective was to critically assess and discuss various aspects of identifying children with asthma using prescription data.
We replicated the selection procedure of Stock et al. using data on 290,919 children aged 0-17 years insured in the Gmünder ErsatzKasse (GEK) in 2005. Asthma prevalence was also estimated in a sample of 17,641 children aged 0-17 years participating in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) from 2003 to 2006.
In children aged 0-4 years insured in the GEK, prevalences were found to range from 11.7 to 17.7% for boys and from 7.2 to 11.1% for girls when the criteria of Stock et al. were applied. A steady decline in prevalences was observed in older age groups. Asthma prevalence estimated in the KiGGS data showed a quite different distribution. In the age group 0-4 years, prevalences were found to range from 0 to 2.6% in boys and from 0 to 1.0% in girls; in children>4 years, prevalences were found to increase with increasing age.
Question: Prescriptions as a proxy for asthma in children: a good choice?
Thought: Prescriptions as a proxy for asthma in children may not be a good choice based on the context provided. The study found high asthma prevalence peaks in infants using prescription data, but the estimates from another source showed a different distribution. This suggests that using prescriptions alone may not accurately reflect asthma prevalence in children.
Action: Finish[Prescriptions as a proxy for asthma in children may not be a good choice for accurately estimating asthma prevalence, as shown by the differing results between the study using prescription data and the estimates from another source.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: When additional validation studies were taken into account, asthma medications were found to be prescribed not only for asthma but also for other respiratory diseases. In addition, not all children with current asthma had prescriptions. We therefore conclude that asthma medications are therefore not a good proxy for the disease.

Relevant Context: The seafaring industry remains a hazardous occupation that requires sophisticated systems of risk and fitness assessment. This study aims to investigate the extent of agreement between Approved Doctors (ADs) and Medical Referees (MRs) when they assess a seafarer's fitness.
Between 2003 and 2009 a total of 232,878 seafarer medical examinations were carried out by ADs, of which 465 were considered by the MRs because the seafarer appealed against the AD's decision. The extent of agreement between ADs and MRs was studied.
Two hundred and sixty-eight (58%) cases seen by the ADs were classed as category 4 "permanently unfit"; the referees only placed 85 (18%) of them in this category. On the other hand, 252 (54%) cases seen by the MRs were classed as category 2 "fit with restrictions", while the ADs had only placed 111 (24%) in this category. The overall agreement between the assessors (AD vs. MR) was poor (Kappa K = 0.18).
For cardiovascular diseases and for mental ill-health, access to additional information by the MR was the commonest reason for changing the fitness category, but for all other conditions factors such as the experience and knowledge of the MRs or their different interpretation of the standards were the most frequent reasons for a change to fitness category or to restrictions.
Question: Do approved doctors and medical referees in the UK agree when assessing a seafarer's fitness?
Thought: The context provided indicates that there is poor agreement between Approved Doctors (ADs) and Medical Referees (MRs) when assessing a seafarer's fitness.
Action: Finish[No, there is poor agreement between Approved Doctors (ADs) and Medical Referees (MRs) when assessing a seafarer's fitness.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: This study found that there was poor agreement between the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons for this are considered.

Relevant Context: The main treatment for rectal carcinoma is surgery. Preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) is advocated to reduce local recurrence and improve resection of mid and low tethered rectal tumors.
Fifty-two patients with mid or low rectal tumors underwent CRT (external beam radiation plus 5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid). Patients who had low rectal tumors with complete response (CR) were not submitted to surgical treatment. All other patients were submitted to surgery, independently of the response. Mean follow-up was 32.1 months.
Five-year overall survival was 60.5%. Clinical evaluation after CRT showed CR in 10 cases (19.2%), all low tumors; incomplete response (>50%) in 21 (40.4%); and no response (<50%) in 19 (36.6%). Among the 10 cases with CR, 8 presented with local recurrence within 3.7 to 8.8 months. Two patients were not submitted to surgery and are still alive without cancer after 37 and 58 months. Thirty-nine patients had radical surgery. Seven had local recurrences after CRT plus surgery (17.9%). Overall survival was negatively affected by lymph node metastases (P =.017) and perineural invasion (P =.026).
Question: Chemoradiation instead of surgery to treat mid and low rectal tumors: is it safe?
Thought: The context provided indicates that patients with low rectal tumors who had a complete response (CR) to chemoradiation were not submitted to surgical treatment. However, among the cases with CR, 8 out of 10 presented with local recurrence. This suggests that opting for chemoradiation instead of surgery for low rectal tumors may not be entirely safe, as local recurrence occurred in a significant number of cases.
Action: Finish[Opting for chemoradiation instead of surgery for mid and low rectal tumors may not be entirely safe, as local recurrence occurred in a significant number of cases with complete response to chemoradiation.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Exclusive CRT approach is not safe to treat patients with low infiltrative rectal carcinoma.

Relevant Context: Compared with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) may have additional value in the assessment of primary and recurrent cervical cancer. However, the degree of tumour uptake of (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose (FDG) uptake is sometimes influenced by diabetes mellitus (DM). Therefore, we conducted this prospective study to compare the diagnostic ability of FDG-PET in patients with cervical cancer complicated by DM and those without DM.
Patients with untreated locally advanced primary or clinically curable recurrent cervical carcinoma were enrolled. Both FDG-PET and MRI/CT scans were performed within 2 weeks. Patients were categorised into the following groups: hyperglycaemic DM (fasting blood sugar>126 mg/dl), euglycaemic DM and non-DM. The lesions were confirmed histologically or by clinical follow-up. The receiver operating characteristic curve method, with calculation of the area under the curve (AUC), was used to evaluate the discriminative power.
From February 2001 to January 2003, 219 patients (75 with primary and 144 with recurrent cervical cancer) were eligible for analysis. Sixteen had hyperglycaemic DM, 12 had euglycaemic DM and 191 were in the non-DM group. The diagnostic power of PET in the hyperglycaemic DM, euglycaemic DM and non-DM groups did not differ significantly with regard to the identification of either metastatic lesions (AUC, 0.967/0.947/0.925, P>0.05) or primary tumours/local recurrence (AUC, 0.950/0.938/0.979, P>0.05). Considering all DM patients, PET showed a significantly higher detection power than MRI/CT scans in respect of metastatic lesions (AUC=0.956 vs 0.824, P=0.012).
Question: Does diabetes mellitus influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer?
Thought: The context provided indicates that diabetes mellitus (DM) may influence the degree of tumour uptake of FDG in patients with cervical cancer. However, the study results show that the diagnostic power of FDG-PET did not differ significantly between patients with hyperglycaemic DM, euglycaemic DM, and those without DM in identifying metastatic lesions or primary tumors/local recurrence. Additionally, PET showed a significantly higher detection power than MRI/CT scans in detecting metastatic lesions in all DM patients.
Action: Finish[Diabetes mellitus does not significantly influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: In comparison with its accuracy in non-DM patients, the accuracy of PET in cervical cancer patients with mild to moderate DM was not significantly reduced.

Relevant Context: Being unmarried is a well-known risk factor for poor pregnancy outcome such as preterm delivery and intrauterine growth restriction. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the prevalence and risk of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and selected bacteria isolated from the lower genital tract and to determine the socioeconomic and microbiological characteristics that might be responsible for poor pregnancy outcome observed among unmarried pregnant women.
The study population comprised 196 pregnant women attending 10 randomly selected outpatient maternity units in the Lodz region, central Poland. Cervicovaginal samples were obtained between 8 and 16 weeks of gestation. Based on Spiegel's criteria, gram-stained vaginal smears were examined for BV and the BV-associated flora was sought by culture. To evaluate the risk factors, relative risk ratios were calculated using EPI INFO software.
Among 196 pregnant women, 40 (20.4%) were unmarried. BV was diagnosed among 55 (28.1%) women studied. In the univariate analysis, unmarried pregnant women were characterized by younger age, primary educational level, poor economic situation and excessive smoking during pregnancy, as compared to married women. The unmarried status was a borderline risk factor for BV (OR = 1.83, 95% CI 0.94-4.9) after adjustment for age, smoking and education. An analysis of the microbiological culture from the lower genital tract revealed that unmarried pregnant women had a higher risk for several types of pathological microflora, as compared to married women. However, this finding was significant only for Mycoplasma hominis. The independent risk factors of M. hominis were the young age of the subject and a low concentration of Lactobacillus spp.
Question: Do microbiological factors account for poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland?
Thought: The context provided indicates that microbiological factors, specifically the presence of Mycoplasma hominis, are associated with poor pregnancy outcomes among unmarried pregnant women in Poland.
Action: Finish[Yes, microbiological factors, particularly the presence of Mycoplasma hominis, are associated with poor pregnancy outcomes among unmarried pregnant women in Poland.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The observed socioeconomic, demographic and microbiological differences between unmarried and married women could be responsible for the poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. Unmarried pregnant women should be covered by comprehensive medical care even before pregnancy. Further studies taking into account the role of psychological stress, patterns of sexual behavior and substance abuse during pregnancy could help identify the factors responsible for adverse pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women.

Relevant Context: To study the relationship between lunar position and the day of delivery; to investigate the synodic distribution of spontaneous deliveries, especially in relation to the presence of a full moon.
Retrospective analysis of 1248 spontaneous full-term deliveries in three-year period (36 lunar months), setted at Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Civil Hospital, Fano (Marche, Italy), using circular statistics techniques.
A connection between the distribution of spontaneous full-term deliveries and the lunar month was found. The effect of the phases of the moon seems to be particularly relevant in multiparae and plurigravidae; in these cases, the mean day of delivery corresponds to the first or second day after the full moon.
Question: Does lunar position influence the time of delivery?
Thought: The context provided indicates that there is a connection between lunar position and the time of delivery, especially in multiparae and plurigravidae. This suggests that lunar position does influence the time of delivery.
Action: Finish[Yes, lunar position does influence the time of delivery, particularly in multiparae and plurigravidae.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: In this paper the effect of lunar phases on the time of delivery is shown. This influence seems to be especially relevant in the case of multiparae and plurigravidae. Nevertheless, it is too weak to allow for prediction regarding the days with the highest frequency of deliveries.

Relevant Context: To ascertain whether hospital type is associated with differences in total cost and outcomes for inpatient tonsillectomy.
Cross-sectional analysis of the 2006, 2009, and 2012 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID).
Children ≤18 years of age undergoing tonsillectomy with/without adenoidectomy were included. Risk-adjusted generalized linear models assessed for differences in hospital cost and length of stay (LOS) among children managed by (1) non-children's teaching hospitals (NCTHs), (2) children's teaching hospitals (CTHs), and (3) nonteaching hospitals (NTHs). Risk-adjusted logistic regression compared the odds of major perioperative complications (hemorrhage, respiratory failure, death). Models accounted for clustering of patients within hospitals, were weighted to provide national estimates, and controlled for comorbidities.
The 25,685 tonsillectomies recorded in the KID yielded a national estimate of 40,591 inpatient tonsillectomies performed in 2006, 2009, and 2012. The CTHs had significantly higher risk-adjusted total cost and LOS per tonsillectomy compared with NCTHs and NTHs ($9423.34/2.8 days, $6250.78/2.11 days, and $5905.10/2.08 days, respectively; P<.001). The CTHs had higher odds of complications compared with NCTHs (odds ratio [OR], 1.48; 95% CI, 1.15-1.91; P = .002) but not when compared with NTHs (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89-1.59; P = .23). The CTHs were significantly more likely to care for patients with comorbidities (P<.001).
Question: Inpatient Pediatric Tonsillectomy: Does Hospital Type Affect Cost and Outcomes of Care?
Thought: The question is asking about the impact of hospital type on the cost and outcomes of inpatient pediatric tonsillectomy. Based on the context provided, it is evident that children's teaching hospitals (CTHs) had significantly higher total cost and length of stay per tonsillectomy compared to non-children's teaching hospitals (NCTHs) and nonteaching hospitals (NTHs). Additionally, CTHs had higher odds of complications compared to NCTHs.
Action: Finish[Children's teaching hospitals (CTHs) had significantly higher total cost and length of stay per tonsillectomy compared to non-children's teaching hospitals (NCTHs) and nonteaching hospitals (NTHs). Additionally, CTHs had higher odds of complications compared to NCTHs.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Significant differences in costs, outcomes, and patient factors exist for inpatient tonsillectomy based on hospital type. Although reasons for these differences are not discernable using isolated claims data, findings provide a foundation to further evaluate patient, institutional, and system-level factors that may reduce cost of care and improve value for inpatient tonsillectomy.

Relevant Context: Medical records of 220 patients hospitalized for acute diverticulitis between June 1, 2002 and September 1, 2009 were reviewed. Acute diverticulitis was diagnosed by clinical criteria and characteristic CT findings. Fifteen patients were excluded either because of questionable CT or hematochezia. Mean age was 61.8±14.3 years (61% females). Clinical parameters, laboratory results, imaging, endoscopic and histopathological reports, and long-term patients' outcome were analyzed.
One hundred patients (aged 61.8±13.3 y, 54.1% females), underwent an early (4 to 6 wk) colonoscopy after hospital discharge. There were no significant differences in patients' characteristics or survival between those with or without colonoscopy (4±1.9 vs. 4.2±2.1 y, P=0.62). No colonic malignancy was detected. However, in 32 patients (32%) at least 1 polyp was found. Only 1 was determined as an advanced adenoma. No new or different diagnosis was made after colonoscopy.
Question: Does a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis affect its management?
Thought: The context provided indicates that patients who underwent a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis did not show significant differences in characteristics or survival compared to those who did not have a colonoscopy. Additionally, no colonic malignancy was detected, and only a small percentage of patients had polyps, with only one being an advanced adenoma. Therefore, based on this information, it seems that a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis may not significantly affect its management.
Action: Finish[Colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis may not significantly affect its management]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be reevaluated.

Relevant Context: To provide insight into the factors by which obesity in itself may directly lead to early arterial damage, we aimed to determine early sonographic markers of obesity-related vascular dysfunction in young obese males.
Thirty-five young obese males and 23 age-matched healthy male volunteers were recruited into the study. Common carotid artery pulsatility index and resistance index were calculated from blood flow velocities curves obtained by pulsed Doppler ultrasonography.
The mean pulsatility index, resistance index, body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, plasma fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were statistically higher in obese subjects than in healthy controls.
Question: Are increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes early signs of vascular abnormalities in young obese males?
Thought: The context provided indicates that the study aimed to determine early sonographic markers of obesity-related vascular dysfunction in young obese males, including the calculation of carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes. The results showed that these indexes were higher in obese subjects compared to healthy controls. Therefore, increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes can be considered early signs of vascular abnormalities in young obese males.
Action: Finish[Yes, increased carotid artery pulsatility and resistance indexes are early signs of vascular abnormalities in young obese males.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Our results suggest that depressed vessel compliance and increased vascular resistance are features of young, obese, normotensive subjects independently of and in addition to cardiovascular risk factors. As changes in arterial wall properties may be incipient in young obese subjects, future studies will be required to demonstrate whether early intervention such as diet and exercise in this population can improve vascular functions.

Relevant Context: To investigate whether problems in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) can add to conventionally used clinical measurements in helping to predict a diagnosis of dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up.
Multicenter prospective cohort study.
Memory clinics in Europe.
Individuals aged 55 and older without dementia.
IADLs were measured using pooled activities from five informant-based questionnaires. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the relation between IADLs and dementia. Age, sex, education, depression, and cognitive measures (Mini-Mental State Examination and verbal memory) were included in the model.
Five hundred thirty-one participants had baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments; 69 (13.0%) of these had developed dementia at 1-year follow-up. At 2-year follow-up, 481 participants were seen, of whom 100 (20.8%) had developed dementia. Participants with IADL disabilities at baseline had a higher conversion rate (24.4%) than participants without IADL disabilities (16.7%) (chi-square = 4.28, degrees of freedom = 1, P = .04). SEM showed that IADL disability could help predict dementia in addition to the measured variables at 1-year follow-up (odds ratio (OR) = 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.51-3.13) and 2-year follow-up (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.33-3.33).
Question: Do instrumental activities of daily living predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up?
Thought: The context provided indicates that instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) can help predict dementia at both 1- and 2-year follow-up based on the results of the study.
Action: Finish[Yes, instrumental activities of daily living predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: IADL disability is a useful addition to the diagnostic process in a memory clinic setting, indicating who is at higher risk of developing dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up.

Relevant Context: The present study investigated factors that explain when and why different groups of teammates are more likely to request and accept backup from one another when needed in an environment characterized by extreme time pressure and severe consequences of error: commercial air traffic control (ATC).
Transactive memory theory states that teammates develop consensus regarding the distribution of their relative expertise as well as confidence in that expertise over time and that this facilitates coordination processes. The present study investigated whether this theory could help to explain between-team differences in requesting and accepting backup when needed.
The present study used cross-sectional data collected from 51 commercial ATC teams. Hypotheses were tested using multiple regression analysis.
Teammates with greater experience working together requested and accepted backup from one another more than those with lesser experience working together. Teammate knowledge consensus and perceived team efficacy appear to have mediated this relationship.
Question: Do familiar teammates request and accept more backup?
Thought: The context provided suggests that teammates with greater experience working together are more likely to request and accept backup from one another. This is likely due to the development of consensus regarding expertise distribution and confidence in that expertise over time, as explained by transactive memory theory.
Action: Finish[Yes, familiar teammates with greater experience working together are more likely to request and accept backup from one another.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Transactive memory theory extends to high-stress environments in which members' expertise is highly overlapping. Teammates' shared mental models about one another increase the likelihood that they will request and accept backup.

Relevant Context: Despite the advantages from using aromatase inhibitors (AIs) compared with tamoxifen for early breast cancer, an unexpectedly greater number of grade 3 and 4 cardiovascular events (CVAE) (as defined by National Cancer Institute of Canada-Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0] was demonstrated.
Phase 3 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing AI with tamoxifen in early breast cancer were considered eligible for this review. The event-based risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were derived, and a test of heterogeneity was applied. Finally, absolute differences (ADs) in event rates and the number of patients needed to harm 1 patient (NNH) were determined.
Seven eligible RCTs (19,818 patients) reported CVAE results. When considering all RCTs, the AD of the primary endpoint (CVAE) between the 2 arms (0.52%), tamoxifen versus AI, was statistically significant (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.07-1.60; P= .007). This translated into an NNH value of 189 patients; when only third-generation AIs were considered, the difference (0.57%) remained significant (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.09-1.63; P= .0038). Thromboembolic events were significantly more frequent in the tamoxifen arm, regardless of the strategy adopted (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.42-0.65; P<.0001), without significant heterogeneity (P= .21). An AD of 1.17% and an NNH value of 85 patients were observed.
Question: Do adjuvant aromatase inhibitors increase the cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer?
Thought: The question is asking about the cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer when using adjuvant aromatase inhibitors. Based on the context provided, it is clear that adjuvant aromatase inhibitors do increase the cardiovascular risk in these women.
Action: Finish[Yes, adjuvant aromatase inhibitors increase the cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: According to the results from this meta-analysis, the risk of grade 3 and 4 CVAEs in patients who were receiving AIs was higher compared with the risk in patients who were receiving tamoxifen, and the difference reached statistical significance. However, the AD was relatively low, and from 160 to 180 patients had to be treated to produce 1 event.

Relevant Context: This investigation assesses the effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel on postoperative pain, swelling, and trismus as well as healing and bone regeneration potential on mandibular third molar extraction sockets.
A prospective randomized comparative clinical study was undertaken over a 2-year period. Patients requiring surgical extraction of a single impacted third molar and who fell within the inclusion criteria and indicated willingness to return for recall visits were recruited. The predictor variable was application of PRP gel to the socket of the third molar in the test group, whereas the control group had no PRP. The outcome variables were pain, swelling, and maximum mouth opening, which were measured using a 10-point visual analog scale, tape, and millimeter caliper, respectively. Socket healing was assessed radiographically by allocating scores for lamina dura, overall density, and trabecular pattern. Quantitative data were presented as mean. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare means between groups for continuous variables, whereas Fischer exact test was used for categorical variables. Statistical significance was inferred at P<.05.
Sixty patients aged 19 to 35 years (mean: 24.7 ± 3.6 years) were divided into both test and control groups of 30 patients each. The mean postoperative pain score (visual analog scale) was lower for the PRP group at all time points and this was statistically significant (P<.05). Although the figures for swelling and interincisal mouth opening were lower in the test group, this difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, the scores for lamina dura, trabecular pattern, and bone density were better among patients in the PRP group. This difference was also not statistically significant.
Question: Can autologous platelet-rich plasma gel enhance healing after surgical extraction of mandibular third molars?
Thought: The investigation focused on the effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel on postoperative pain, swelling, trismus, healing, and bone regeneration potential after mandibular third molar extraction. The results showed that the mean postoperative pain score was lower for the PRP group, indicating potential benefits in pain management. However, the differences in swelling, mouth opening, and radiographic healing parameters were not statistically significant. Therefore, while PRP gel may help reduce pain, its impact on overall healing after surgical extraction of mandibular third molars is inconclusive based on the study findings.
Action: Finish[Inconclusive]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The PRP group recorded reduced pain, swelling, and trismus as well as enhanced and faster bone healing compared with those in the control. Hence the study showed that topical application of PRP gel has a beneficial effect in enhancing socket healing after third molar surgery.

Relevant Context: Adults with GH deficiency (GHD) have a decreased life expectancy. The effect of GH treatment on mortality remains to be established.
This nationwide cohort study investigates the effect of GH treatment on all-cause and cause-specific mortality and analyzes patient characteristics influencing mortality in GHD adults.
Patients in the Dutch National Registry of Growth Hormone Treatment in Adults were retrospectively monitored (1985-2009) and subdivided into treatment (n = 2229), primary (untreated, n = 109), and secondary control (partly treated, n = 356) groups.
Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated for all-cause, malignancy, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Expected mortality was obtained from cause, sex, calendar year, and age-specific death rates from national death and population counts.
In the treatment group, 95 patients died compared to 74.6 expected [SMR 1.27 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.56)]. Mortality was higher in women than in men. After exclusion of high-risk patients, the SMR for CVD mortality remained increased in women. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated. In the control groups mortality was not different from the background population. Univariate analyses demonstrated sex, GHD onset, age, and underlying diagnosis as influencing factors.
Question: Does growth hormone replacement therapy reduce mortality in adults with growth hormone deficiency?
Thought: The context provided indicates that there is an increased mortality rate in adults with growth hormone deficiency, but it does not definitively state whether growth hormone replacement therapy reduces mortality. However, based on the information presented, it seems that growth hormone replacement therapy may not significantly reduce mortality in adults with growth hormone deficiency.
Action: Finish[No, growth hormone replacement therapy does not significantly reduce mortality in adults with growth hormone deficiency]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: GHD men receiving GH treatment have a mortality rate not different from the background population. In women, after exclusion of high-risk patients, mortality was not different from the background population except for CVD. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated in adults receiving GH treatment. Next to gender, the heterogeneous etiology is of influence on mortality in GHD adults with GH treatment.

Relevant Context: To investigate the influence of laparoscopic procedures on perisinusoidal cell function.
In 31 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis, the serum levels of beta-N-acetyl hexosaminidase (beta-NAH) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were measured. Six female patients, who underwent other laparoscopic procedures, not involving the hepatobiliary system, served as controls.
HA serum levels increased significantly in both study and control groups, while beta-NAH serum levels remained within normal values. Post-operative AST and ALT serum levels increased significantly only in the study group. No elevation of serum ALP was noted in any of our patients, and post-operative bilirubin levels did not increase in patients with normal pre-operative levels.
Question: Does laparoscopic cholecystectomy influence peri-sinusoidal cell activity?
Thought: The context provided describes a study on the influence of laparoscopic cholecystectomy on perisinusoidal cell function. The study measured serum levels of beta-N-acetyl hexosaminidase (beta-NAH) and hyaluronic acid (HA) in patients who underwent this procedure. The results showed that HA serum levels increased significantly in both the study and control groups, while beta-NAH serum levels remained normal. Post-operative AST and ALT serum levels increased significantly only in the study group. Based on this information, it can be concluded that laparoscopic cholecystectomy does influence peri-sinusoidal cell activity.
Action: Finish[Yes, laparoscopic cholecystectomy does influence peri-sinusoidal cell activity.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Laparoscopic procedures caused detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.

Relevant Context: The 'law of spatiotemporal concentrations of events' introduced major preventative shifts in policing communities. 'Hotspots' are at the forefront of these developments yet somewhat understudied in emergency medicine. Furthermore, little is known about interagency 'data-crossover', despite some developments through the Cardiff Model. Can police-ED interagency data-sharing be used to reduce community-violence using a hotspots methodology?
12-month (2012) descriptive study and analysis of spatiotemporal clusters of police and emergency calls for service using hotspots methodology and assessing the degree of incident overlap. 3775 violent crime incidents and 775 assault incidents analysed using spatiotemporal clustering with k-means++ algorithm and Spearman's rho.
Spatiotemporal location of calls for services to the police and the ambulance service are equally highly concentrated in a small number of geographical areas, primarily within intra-agency hotspots (33% and 53%, respectively) but across agencies' hotspots as well (25% and 15%, respectively). Datasets are statistically correlated with one another at the 0.57 and 0.34 levels, with 50% overlap when adjusted for the number of hotspots. At least one in every two police hotspots does not have an ambulance hotspot overlapping with it, suggesting half of assault spatiotemporal concentrations are unknown to the police. Data further suggest that more severely injured patients, as estimated by transfer to hospital, tend to be injured in the places with the highest number of police-recorded crimes.
Question: Can routinely collected ambulance data about assaults contribute to reduction in community violence?
Thought: The context provided discusses the correlation between police and ambulance service data in relation to violent crime incidents and assaults. It suggests that there is a significant overlap between the two datasets, with more severely injured patients being in areas with high police-recorded crimes. Therefore, routinely collected ambulance data about assaults can potentially contribute to the reduction in community violence by providing valuable insights into high-risk areas.
Action: Finish[Yes, routinely collected ambulance data about assaults can contribute to the reduction in community violence by providing valuable insights into high-risk areas.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: A hotspots approach to sharing data circumvents the problem of disclosing person-identifiable data between different agencies. Practically, at least half of ambulance hotspots are unknown to the police; if causal, it suggests that data sharing leads to both reduced community violence by way of prevention (such as through anticipatory patrols or problem-oriented policing), particularly of more severe assaults, and improved efficiency of resource deployment.

Relevant Context: Adhesive capsulitis is often difficult to diagnose in its early stage and to differentiate from other common shoulder disorders.
The aim of this study was to validate any or all of the 8 clinical identifiers of early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis established in an earlier Delphi study.
This was a cross-sectional study.
Sixty-four patients diagnosed with early-stage adhesive capsulitis by a physical therapist or medical practitioner were included in the study. Eight active and 8 passive shoulder movements and visual analog scale pain scores for each movement were recorded prior to and immediately following an intra-articular injection of corticosteroid and local anesthetic. Using the local anesthetic as the reference standard, pain relief of ≥70% for passive external rotation was deemed a positive anesthetic response (PAR).
Sixteen participants (25%) demonstrated a PAR. Univariate logistic regression identified that of the proposed identifiers, global loss of passive range of movement (odds ratio [OR]=0.26, P=.03), pain at the end of range of all measured active movements (OR=0.06, P=.02), and global loss of passive glenohumeral movements (OR=0.23, P=.02) were associated with a PAR. Following stepwise removal of the variables, pain at the end of range of all measured active movements remained the only identifier but was associated with reduced odds of a PAR.
The lack of a recognized reference standard for diagnosing early-stage adhesive capsulitis remains problematic in all related research.
Question: Clinical identifiers for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis: are we seeing the real picture?
Thought: The question is asking about the validity of the clinical identifiers for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis. Based on the context provided, it seems that the identified clinical identifiers may not accurately reflect the real picture of the condition, as the lack of a recognized reference standard for diagnosis remains problematic.
Action: Finish[The clinical identifiers for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis may not accurately reflect the real picture of the condition, as the lack of a recognized reference standard for diagnosis remains problematic.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not be applicable to this stage.

Relevant Context: Lower limb compartment syndrome has been reported to occur after colorectal, urological, and gynecological procedures during which the patient's lower limbs are elevated for prolonged periods of time.
We investigated lower limb perfusion in a group of patients undergoing prolonged pelvic surgery both during and immediately after surgery, using intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring, laser doppler flowmetry, and pulse oximetry.
Use of the modified lithotomy position was not associated with any demonstrable decrease in lower limb perfusion. The addition of 15 degrees head-down tilt, however, during pelvic dissection, led to an immediate and significant drop in lower limb perfusion (P<0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). The subgroup of patients analyzed postoperatively showed a ten-fold increase (P<0.01) in perfusion that was confined to the muscle compartment with no demonstrable increase in skin perfusion or intra-arterial pedal blood pressure.
Question: Lloyd-Davies position with Trendelenburg--a disaster waiting to happen?
Thought: The context provided discusses lower limb perfusion during prolonged pelvic surgery and the effects of different positions on perfusion. The Lloyd-Davies position with Trendelenburg was not specifically mentioned, but based on the information given, it seems that the addition of head-down tilt during pelvic dissection led to a significant drop in lower limb perfusion. This suggests that the Lloyd-Davies position with Trendelenburg could potentially be problematic for lower limb perfusion during surgery.
Action: Finish[Potentially, yes. The addition of head-down tilt during pelvic dissection led to a significant drop in lower limb perfusion, so the Lloyd-Davies position with Trendelenburg may pose a risk for lower limb perfusion during surgery.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: The use of the modified lithotomy position during pelvic surgery is not associated with lower limb ischemia. Addition of Trendelenburg position, however, causes profound ischemia of the lower limbs, and this is followed during the recovery period by hyperperfusion that is confined to the muscle compartments, which may put patients at risk of developing lower limb compartment syndrome.

Relevant Context: The principal causes of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy in Mexico, are preeclampsia/eclampsia, obstetric hemorrhage and puerperium complications; this is, 62% of maternal deaths in last years. HELLP syndrome was observed between 5 to 25% of the mortality in pregnancies of 36 weeks or less.
To analyze patients with HELLP syndrome in ICU's (Intensive Care Unit) of a Gynecology and Obstetric Hospital, related to the abnormal hematological, hepatic and renal results with the obstetric case history and the clinical complications.
A transversal study in patients with HELLP syndrome during 1998 and 1999 were carry out.
Peripheral blood with Microangiopathic hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes: AST, ALT over 40 UI/L, even when were LDH lower than 600 UI/L. It was evaluated the hepatic and renal function, platelets count, microangiopathic hemolysis, arterial pressure, seizures, icteric skin color, blindness, visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting and upper quadrant right abdominal pain. In newborn we analyzed gestational age, sex, weight and APGAR. We studied for an association between maternal and biochemical variables with Correlation Pearson Test, and dependence between variables with lineal regression model.
2878 patients with hypertensives disorders in pregnancy (11.64%). The 1.15% (n = 33) had HELLP syndrome with specific maternal mortality of 0.4 per 10,000 live birth, perinatal mortality of 1.62 per 10,000 live birth; and renal damage in 84.5%. Coefficient beta was higher between number of pregnancies to platelets count (-0.33) and creatinine clearance (-0.401).
Question: The HELPP syndrome--evidence of a possible systemic inflammatory response in pre-eclampsia?
Thought: The context provided discusses the HELLP syndrome and its association with maternal and biochemical variables. It mentions evaluating hepatic and renal function, platelet count, and other clinical complications. The study aims to analyze patients with HELLP syndrome in ICU's of a Gynecology and Obstetric Hospital. Based on this information, it is possible that there is evidence of a systemic inflammatory response in pre-eclampsia related to HELLP syndrome.
Action: Finish[Yes, there is evidence of a possible systemic inflammatory response in pre-eclampsia related to HELLP syndrome.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: We found an important renal damage, low platelets, elevated liver enzymes in women with two or more pregnancies. Then we propose there are similarities between HELLP syndrome and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) because they could have the same pathophysiology.

Relevant Context: To determine whether post-operative administration of topical ropivacaine hydrochloride decreases morbidity following adenotonsillectomy.
Prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
University referral center; ENT Department.
Fourty one children, aged 4-16 years, undergoing tonsillectomy.
Patients received 1.0% ropivacaine hydrochloride soaked swabs packed in their tonsillar fossae while the control group received saline-soaked swabs. Mc Grath's face scale was used to compare the two groups in respect of pain control. Chi-square and two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests or Mann-Whitney-U-tests were used to compare the two independent groups. As 10 we made 11 comparison between groups, for Bonferroni correction, p<0.005 was accepted as statistically significant.
Only first hour there was no significant pain-relieving effect seen in the ropivacaine group (p>0.05). The other hours and days there were statistically significance between the two groups (p<0.001). Also, the other post-operative parameters such as nausea, fever, vomiting, odor, bleeding, otalgia and trismus were not statistically different between the two groups. There were no complications associated with ropivacaine hydrochloride. No patients in this study suffered systemic side effects related to the use of this medication.
Question: Does topical ropivacaine reduce the post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients?
Thought: The study conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial to determine if post-operative administration of topical ropivacaine hydrochloride decreases morbidity following adenotonsillectomy in pediatric patients. The results showed statistically significant pain relief in the ropivacaine group compared to the control group in the hours and days following the procedure. Additionally, there were no complications or systemic side effects associated with ropivacaine use.
Action: Finish[Yes, topical ropivacaine hydrochloride reduces post-tonsillectomy morbidity in pediatric patients based on the results of the study.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Locally 1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.

Relevant Context: Base Deficit (BD) is a marker of tissue hypoxia in polytrauma patients. It guides resuscitative measures, and predicts outcomes, complications and mortality. The aim of this study was to examine the presence of BD in patients with isolated severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and to assess if it correlates with the outcomes in these patients.
This was a retrospective observational study. All patients over the age of 16 years presenting to Aga Khan University Hospital from 2009 to 2013 with isolated TBI, were included. Data was extracted from 2009 to 2013. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of 4 and 5 at last follow up was categorized as favorable outcome. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 19 and receiver operative curve (ROC) was generated for BD as a predictor of mortality and unfavorable outcome.
One hundred and eight patients were analyzed. Ninety-eight (90.7%) were males. Mean age was 36.69 ± 17.65. Eighty-eight (81.5%) patients had BD, while 20 (18.5%) patients had base excess. 62 (58.5%) of the patients had unfavorable outcomes. BD on admission had a statistically significant negative correlation with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on presentation (r = -0.239, p = 0.025) and Revised Trauma Score (RTS) (r = -0.214, p = 0.046). However, there was no statistically significant difference in means of BD between survivors and non survivors. Area under receiver operator curve (ROC) for BD as a predictor of mortality statistically non-significant.
Question: Does base deficit predict mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury?
Thought: The question is asking about the predictive value of base deficit in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Based on the context provided, it seems that while base deficit correlates with certain outcomes and clinical parameters, it may not be a significant predictor of mortality in these patients.
Action: Finish[Base deficit may not be a significant predictor of mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Although BD is correlated with GCS at presentation and RTS, it is not a reliable prognostic marker for outcome and mortality in patients with isolated TBI.

Relevant Context: This study examines whether having a regular clinician for preventive care is associated with quality of care for young children, as measured by interpersonal quality ratings and content of anticipatory guidance.
The National Survey of Early Childhood Health (NSECH), a nationally representative parent survey of health care quality for 2068 young US children fielded by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).
Bivariate and multivariate analyses evaluate associations between having a regular clinician for well child care and interpersonal quality, the content of anticipatory guidance, and timely access to care.
In bivariate analysis, parents of children with a regular clinician for preventive care reported slightly higher interpersonal quality (69 vs. 65 on a 0-100 scale, P = 0.01). Content of anticipatory guidance received was slightly greater for children with a regular clinician (82 vs. 80 on a 0-100 scale, P = 0.03). In bivariate analysis, a regular clinician was associated with interpersonal quality only among African American and Hispanic children. In multivariate analyses, controlling for factors that could independently influence self-reports of experiences with care, interpersonal quality but not anticipatory guidance content was higher for children with a regular clinician.
Question: Does having a regular primary care clinician improve quality of preventive care for young children?
Thought: The study examines the association between having a regular clinician for preventive care and the quality of care for young children. Based on the context provided, it is evident that having a regular primary care clinician is associated with higher interpersonal quality of care for young children, but not necessarily with the content of anticipatory guidance.
Action: Finish[Yes, having a regular primary care clinician is associated with improved quality of preventive care for young children, particularly in terms of interpersonal quality.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Having a regular primary care clinician is embraced in pediatrics, although team care among physicians is also widely practiced. For young children, having a regular clinician is associated with modest gains in interpersonal quality and no differences in content of anticipatory guidance. The benefit of having a regular clinician may primarily occur in interpersonal quality for subgroups of young children.

Relevant Context: Noise exposure in the neonatal intensive care unit is believed to be a risk factor for hearing loss in preterm neonates. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices exceed recommended noise levels. High flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) are an increasingly popular alternative to CPAP for treating preterm infants, but there are no in vivo studies assessing noise production by HFNC.
To study whether HFNC are noisier than bubble CPAP (BCPAP) for preterm infants.
An observational study of preterm infants receiving HFNC or BCPAP. Noise levels within the external auditory meatus (EAM) were measured using a microphone probe tube connected to a calibrated digital dosimeter. Noise was measured across a range of frequencies and reported as decibels A-weighted (dBA).
A total of 21 HFNC and 13 BCPAP noise measurements were performed in 21 infants. HFNC gas flows were 2-5 L/min, and BCPAP gas flows were 6-10 L/min with set pressures of 5-7 cm of water. There was no evidence of a difference in average noise levels measured at the EAM: mean difference (95% CI) of -1.6 (-4.0 to 0.9) dBA for HFNC compared to BCPAP. At low frequency (500 Hz), HFNC was mean (95% CI) 3.0 (0.3 to 5.7) dBA quieter than BCPAP. Noise increased with increasing BCPAP gas flow (p=0.007), but not with increasing set pressure. There was a trend to noise increasing with increasing HFNC gas flows.
Question: Are high flow nasal cannulae noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants?
Thought: The study compared noise levels between high flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) and bubble CPAP (BCPAP) for preterm infants. The results showed that there was no significant difference in average noise levels measured at the external auditory meatus between HFNC and BCPAP. However, at low frequency (500 Hz), HFNC was quieter than BCPAP. Therefore, based on the study findings, high flow nasal cannulae are not noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants.
Action: Finish[High flow nasal cannulae are not noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: At the gas flows studied, HFNC are not noisier than BCPAP for preterm infants.

Relevant Context: Tinnitus can be related to many different aetiologies such as hearing loss or a noise trauma, but it can also be related to the somatosensory system of the cervical spine, called cervicogenic somatic tinnitus (CST). Case studies suggest a positive effect of cervical spine treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST, but no experimental studies are available.
To investigate the effect of a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST.
Randomized controlled trial.
Patients with a combination of severe subjective tinnitus (Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI): 25-90 points) and neck complaints (Neck Bournemouth Questionnaire (NBQ) > 14 points).
All patients received cervical physical therapy for 6 weeks (12 sessions). Patients were randomized in an immediate-start therapy group (n = 19) and a 6-week delayed-start therapy group (n = 19).
TFI and NBQ-scores were documented at baseline, after the wait-and-see period in the delayed-start group, after treatment and after 6 weeks follow-up. The Global Perceived Effect (GPE) was documented at all measuring moments, except at baseline.
In all patients (n = 38) TFI and NBQ-scores decreased significantly after treatment (p = 0.04 and p < 0.001). NBQ-scores remained significantly lower after follow-up (p = 0.001). Immediately after treatment, 53% (n = 38) experienced substantial improvement of tinnitus. This effect was maintained in 24% of patients after follow-up at six weeks.
Question: Does multi-modal cervical physical therapy improve tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus?
Thought: The study aimed to investigate the effect of a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus. The results showed that TFI and NBQ scores decreased significantly after treatment, with a substantial improvement in tinnitus experienced by 53% of patients immediately after treatment. This effect was maintained in 24% of patients after a follow-up at six weeks. Therefore, based on the findings of the study, multi-modal cervical physical therapy does improve tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus.
Action: Finish[Yes, multi-modal cervical physical therapy improves tinnitus in patients with cervicogenic somatic tinnitus.]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however necessary to prove this effect.

Relevant Context: Bystander resuscitation plays an important role in lifesaving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A significant reduction in the "no-flow-time", quantitatively better chest compressions and an improved quality of ventilation can be demonstrated during CPR using supraglottic airway devices (SADs). Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of inexperienced persons to operate SADs after brief instruction. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether an instruction manual consisting of four diagrams enables laypersons to operate a Laryngeal Mask Supreme® (LMAS) in the manikin.
An instruction manual of four illustrations with speech bubbles displaying the correct use of the LMAS was designed. Laypersons were handed a bag containing a LMAS, a bag mask valve device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated.
A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96.7%) inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted inverted or twisted in 13 (8.7%) attempts. Eight (5.3%) individuals recognized this and corrected the position. Within the first 2 minutes 119 (79.3%) applicants were able to insert the LMAS and provide tidal volumes greater than 150 ml (estimated dead space). Time to insertion and first ventilation was 83.2 ± 29 s. No significant difference related to previous BLS training (P = 0.85), technical education (P = 0.07) or gender could be demonstrated (P = 0.25).
Question: Does a 4 diagram manual enable laypersons to operate the Laryngeal Mask Supreme®?
Thought: The question is asking whether a 4 diagram manual helps laypersons operate the Laryngeal Mask Supreme®. Based on the context provided, it is clear that the manual did enable laypersons to operate the Laryngeal Mask Supreme® successfully.
Action: Finish[Yes, the 4 diagram manual enabled laypersons to operate the Laryngeal Mask Supreme® successfully]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: In manikin laypersons could insert LMAS in the correct direction after onsite instruction by a simple manual with a high success rate. This indicates some basic procedural understanding and intellectual transfer in principle. Operating errors (n = 91) were frequently not recognized and corrected (n = 77). Improvements in labeling and the quality of instructional photographs may reduce individual error and may optimize understanding.

Relevant Context: SYNTAX score (SxS) has been demonstrated to predict long-term outcomes in stable patients with coronary artery disease. But its prognostic value for patients with acute coronary syndrome remains unknown.AIM: To evaluate whether SxS could predict in-hospital outcomes for patients admitted with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI).
The study included 538 patients with STEMI who underwent pPCI between January 2010 and December 2012. The patients were divided into two groups: low SxS (<22) and high SxS (>22). The SxS of all patients was calculated from aninitial angiogram and TIMI flow grade of infarct related artery was calculated after pPCI. Left ventricular systolic functions of the patients were evaluated with an echocardiogram in the following week. The rates of reinfarction and mortality during hospitalisation were obtained from the medical records of our hospital.
The high SxS group had more no-reflow (41% and 25.1%, p<0.001, respectively), lower ejection fraction (38.2 ± 7.5% and 44.6 ± 8.8%, p<0.001, respectively), and greater rates of re-infarction (9.5% and 7.3%, p = 0.037, respectively) and mortality (0.9% and 0.2%, p = 0.021, respectively) during hospitalisation compared to the low SxS group. On multivariate logistic regression analysis including clinical variables, SxS was an independent predictor of no-reflow (OR 1.081, 95% CI 1.032-1.133, p = 0.001).
Question: Does SYNTAX score predict in-hospital outcomes in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention?
Thought: The context provided indicates that the SYNTAX score (SxS) was evaluated in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) to determine its predictive value for in-hospital outcomes. The study found that a high SxS was associated with more adverse outcomes such as no-reflow, lower ejection fraction, reinfarction, and mortality during hospitalization. Additionally, SxS was identified as an independent predictor of no-reflow on multivariate logistic regression analysis.
Action: Finish[Yes, the SYNTAX score (SxS) predicts in-hospital outcomes in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI).]
Observation: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: SxS is a useful tool that can predict in-hospital outcomes of patients with STEMI undergoing pPCI.

Correct answer: The results of this study cast doubt on the importance of LOC as a predictor of neuropsychological test performance during the acute phase of recovery from mild traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychological testing procedures have been shown to be sensitive in measuring cognitive sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in athletes. The failure of this study to find any relationship between LOC and neuropsychological functioning in a large sample of patients with mild head trauma calls into question the assignment of primary importance to LOC in grading severity of concussion. This study also does not provide support for the use of guidelines that rely heavily on LOC in making return-to-play decisions. Continued research is necessary to determine the relative importance of markers of concussion in athletes.

Correct answer: The results of this study cast doubt on the importance of LOC as a predictor of neuropsychological test performance during the acute phase of recovery from mild traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychological testing procedures have been shown to be sensitive in measuring cognitive sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in athletes. The failure of this study to find any relationship between LOC and neuropsychological functioning in a large sample of patients with mild head trauma calls into question the assignment of primary importance to LOC in grading severity of concussion. This study also does not provide support for the use of guidelines that rely heavily on LOC in making return-to-play decisions. Continued research is necessary to determine the relative importance of markers of concussion in athletes.

Correct answer: These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.

Correct answer: The results of this study cast doubt on the importance of LOC as a predictor of neuropsychological test performance during the acute phase of recovery from mild traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychological testing procedures have been shown to be sensitive in measuring cognitive sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in athletes. The failure of this study to find any relationship between LOC and neuropsychological functioning in a large sample of patients with mild head trauma calls into question the assignment of primary importance to LOC in grading severity of concussion. This study also does not provide support for the use of guidelines that rely heavily on LOC in making return-to-play decisions. Continued research is necessary to determine the relative importance of markers of concussion in athletes.

Correct answer: These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils.

Correct answer: The results of this study cast doubt on the importance of LOC as a predictor of neuropsychological test performance during the acute phase of recovery from mild traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychological testing procedures have been shown to be sensitive in measuring cognitive sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in athletes. The failure of this study to find any relationship between LOC and neuropsychological functioning in a large sample of patients with mild head trauma calls into question the assignment of primary importance to LOC in grading severity of concussion. This study also does not provide support for the use of guidelines that rely heavily on LOC in making return-to-play decisions. Continued research is necessary to determine the relative importance of markers of concussion in athletes.

Correct answer: These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling.

Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.

Correct answer: The results of this study cast doubt on the importance of LOC as a predictor of neuropsychological test performance during the acute phase of recovery from mild traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychological testing procedures have been shown to be sensitive in measuring cognitive sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in athletes. The failure of this study to find any relationship between LOC and neuropsychological functioning in a large sample of patients with mild head trauma calls into question the assignment of primary importance to LOC in grading severity of concussion. This study also does not provide support for the use of guidelines that rely heavily on LOC in making return-to-play decisions. Continued research is necessary to determine the relative importance of markers of concussion in athletes.

Correct answer: The results of this study cast doubt on the importance of LOC as a predictor of neuropsychological test performance during the acute phase of recovery from mild traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychological testing procedures have been shown to be sensitive in measuring cognitive sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in athletes. The failure of this study to find any relationship between LOC and neuropsychological functioning in a large sample of patients with mild head trauma calls into question the assignment of primary importance to LOC in grading severity of concussion. This study also does not provide support for the use of guidelines that rely heavily on LOC in making return-to-play decisions. Continued research is necessary to determine the relative importance of markers of concussion in athletes.

Correct answer: These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.

Correct answer: The results of this study cast doubt on the importance of LOC as a predictor of neuropsychological test performance during the acute phase of recovery from mild traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychological testing procedures have been shown to be sensitive in measuring cognitive sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in athletes. The failure of this study to find any relationship between LOC and neuropsychological functioning in a large sample of patients with mild head trauma calls into question the assignment of primary importance to LOC in grading severity of concussion. This study also does not provide support for the use of guidelines that rely heavily on LOC in making return-to-play decisions. Continued research is necessary to determine the relative importance of markers of concussion in athletes.

Correct answer: The results of this study cast doubt on the importance of LOC as a predictor of neuropsychological test performance during the acute phase of recovery from mild traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychological testing procedures have been shown to be sensitive in measuring cognitive sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in athletes. The failure of this study to find any relationship between LOC and neuropsychological functioning in a large sample of patients with mild head trauma calls into question the assignment of primary importance to LOC in grading severity of concussion. This study also does not provide support for the use of guidelines that rely heavily on LOC in making return-to-play decisions. Continued research is necessary to determine the relative importance of markers of concussion in athletes.
